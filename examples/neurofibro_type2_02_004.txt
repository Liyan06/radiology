Diseases: ['schwannoma', 'meningitis']
FINDINGS:

There is a 1.3 cm (anterior-posterior) by 1.6 cm (transverse) by 1.9 cm (craniocaudal) T1 hypointense T2 hyperintense homogeneously enhancing lesion without evidence of restricted diffusion or susceptibility effect originating from the left side of tentorium cerebelli. This lesion corresponds to the hyperdensity noticed on the recent CT and represents an meningioma. In addition a smaller 6 mm in diameter lesion with similar characteristics is noted anterior laterally to the lesion described above and likely represents another meningioma. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Mild mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral ethmoid and right frontal sinuses. There is a small retention cyst in the sphenoid sinus and trace fluid in the left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Two left tentorial meningiomas as described above. 2. No evidence of hemorrhage. 3. Minimal inflammatory changes in paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells as described above. Attending note: I agree with the report above and have personally reviewed the images. While meningiomas are statistically the most likely diagnosis these are not typical in appearance on the T2 weighted scan (they are unusually bright). In addition there is evidence of an enhancing lesion in the distal right internal auditory canal. This would suggest the possibility of a acoustic schwannoma. Neurofibromatosis type II is less likely without a lesion on the left side. One final consideration would be dural metastatic disease with carcinomatous meningitis manifesting in the IAC and consider spinal tap if warranted. Follow up imaging in one to two months time is certainly warranted because of the atypical nature of these lesions and the presence of the IAC lesion as well. The findings were relayed directly to Dr. Shah at 12:20 p.m. on August 27 2008.
