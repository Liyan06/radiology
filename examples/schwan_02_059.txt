Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

There are right sided posttreatment changes with surgical resection of the majority of the right parotid gland. There is a homogenously enhancing 1.8 x 1.8 cm pedunculated right cerebellopontine angle mass with dural tails that extend both above and below the internal auditory canal There is mass effect on the right middle cerebellar peduncle with associated edema of the peduncle. This mass extends into and expands the right internal auditory canal. There is enhancing tissue extending into the epitympanum as well as medial aspect of the mastoid bone/air cells with osseous destruction seen on recent head CT. Enhancing tissue abuts the inferior middle cranial fossa such that involvement of the dura in this region is not excluded. There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells. There are small bilateral subacute right greater than left cerebral convexity subdural hematomas predominantly layering posteriorly. Periventricular deep and subcortical white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci nonspecific likely small vessel ischemic changes. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right sided cerebellopontine angle/internal auditory canal enhancing mass with extension as above concerning for possible metastatic disease. The aggressive features and extension make this atypical for schwannoma. 2. Small right greater than left subacute subdural hematomas predominantly layering posteriorly. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
