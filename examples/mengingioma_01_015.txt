Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is a small 7 x 6 x 7 mm extra-axial enhancing lesion along the falx cerebri which minimally abuts the adjacent aspects superior frontal gyri and exerts minimal if any mass effect; this is similar morphologically to sinus CT in 2007. Additional punctate focus of enhancement measuring approximately 3 mm image 23 series 8 subcortical white matter right superior frontal gyrus which appears somewhat more curvilinear and less well defined on coronal image (image 24 series 9) and may represent a vascular lesion such as a developmental venous anomaly given that it is not well seen on other imaging sequences and lack of appreciable edema from this lesion. Few scattered nonspecific nonenhancing FLAIR hyperintensities within the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter. No extra-axial fluid collections midline shift or ventriculomegaly. No restricted diffusion. Frontal ethmoidal mucosal changes. Spondylotic changes in the upper cervical spine noted. Bilateral degenerative changes mandibular condyles. No discrete suspicious marrow signal abnormalities. Orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. 7-mm midline falx cerebri lesion similar morphologically to sinus CT and 2007 and most consistent with meningioma. There is minimal if any local mass effect from this lesion. 2. Nonspecific focus of enhancement within subcortical white matter right frontal lobe which appears more ill-defined and somewhat curvilinear on coronal sequence. While this is favored to be vascular in origin possibly a developmental venous anomaly given its contrast-enhanced appearance and lack of edema it is difficult to completely characterize given small size and ongoing attention to this is recommended on short interval follow-up imaging. 3. Nonspecific white matter findings as detailed.
