Diseases: ['meningitis']
FINDINGS:

There is diffuse linear abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement supra-and infratentorially with minimal associated flair sulcal hyperintensity along medial cerebellar hemispheres posterior occipital lobes and left greater than right sylvian fissures. Few punctate scattered foci of increased signal on diffusion weighted imaging in right greater than left medial inferior cerebellar hemispheres suspicious for punctate foci of acute to subacute ischemia. Correlation with ADC mapping is difficult secondary to the tiny size of these foci. Cerebral volume within normal limits. No acute intracranial hemorrhage mass-effect midline shift extra-axial collection or abnormal foci of magnetic susceptibility. Brain parenchymal signal otherwise unremarkable. Patient intubated with fluid layering in nasopharynx. Mild paranasal sinus mucosal disease and opacification of scattered bilateral mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement with minimal associated flair sulcal hyperintensity. Findings are concerning for meningitis and clinical correlation with lumbar puncture recommended. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is felt to be unlikely given the diffuse and linear appearance of the leptomeningeal enhancement. 2. Tiny punctate foci of increased signal on diffusion weighted imaging in right greater than left medial inferior cerebellar hemispheres suspicious for punctate foci of acute to subacute ischemia. These results were discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Brennan of the referring ICU service via telephone at 2:40 a.m. 3/24/11. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I agree with the preliminary report without modification. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
