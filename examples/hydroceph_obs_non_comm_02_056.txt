Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is a ring enhancing lesion in the left midbrain withassociated edema extending superiorly to involve the left thalamusand inferiorly to the pons . This is slightly increased in sizewith increased restricted diffusion and necrosis. This likelyrepresents an infectious sequela/small abscess.There has been interval placement of a right ventriculostomy tubeinto the right lateral ventricle. There is obstructivehydrocephalus at the level of the third ventricle as result ofmass effect with transependymal spread of CSF slightly improvedfrom prior examination.There is clival marrow heterogeneity which is indicative ofmarrow infiltration and can be seen in chronic infiltrativedisorder or anemia.There is bilateral maxillary mucosal disease left greater thanright.No extraaxial fluid collections are seen.Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posteriorcirculation as well as the superior sagittal sinus.Both orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Ring enhancing lesion seen within the left midbrain withextensive edema. This has slightly increased in size slightlyfrom prior examination favoring an infectious etiology .2. Slightly decreased obstructive hydrocephalus status post rightventriculostomy placement.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
