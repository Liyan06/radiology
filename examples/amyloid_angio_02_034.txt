FINDINGS:

Since prior exam the T1 and T2 hyperintense hematoma in the right occipital lobe has resolved. There is associated mild encephalomalacia gliosis and lamina necrosis in the region of prior hematoma. Inferior to this there is a stable oval 1.8 cm x 0.9 cm area inferior right occipital lobe with mixed signal intensity and periperial T2 hypointense rim and surrounding T2 hyperintensity is unchanged. There is hemosiderin staining and volume loss suggesting prior hemorrhage in this region. On susceptibility weighted images there is an addition focus of susceptibility in the right occipital other than the areas of prior hemorrhage. There is hemosiderin staining of the sulci of right occipital lobe likely related to prior subarachnoid extension of hemorrhage. There is no convincing pathologic enhancement. Scattered foci of periventricular subcortical and to a lesser extent deep white matter T2 prolongation nonspecific and stable likely reflecting sequela of chronic small vessel ischemia in patient of this age. No acute intracranial hemorrhage mass effect midline shift hydrocephalus or acute infarction. Mild cerebral volume loss is age appropriate. Expected flow voids of the major intracranial vessels are present at the skull base. Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval resolution of the right occipital lobe hematoma with associated encephalomalacic changes and hemosiderin staining. No convincing pathologic enhancement. 2. Stable additional small area of encephalomalacia and hemosiderin staining in the adjacent inferior right occipital lobe. Given these findings differential considerations include hemorrhagic transformation of infarcts or amyloid angiopathy. Other vascular malformations including cavernomas are less likely. 3. Stable probable sequela of chronic small vessel ischemia.
