FINDINGS:

There is homogeneously enhancing extraaxial mass centered in theanterior aspect of the right middle cranial fossa extendingposteriorly and medially alongside the cavernous sinus to thetentorial incisure. The cavernous sinus itself is unremarkablewithin the limits of this exam and the right internal carotidflow void is maintained. The enhancing tissue extends superiorlyalong the anterior and lateral aspects of the middle cranialfossa and appears to extend over the roof of the right orbitalapex (series for images 44-47). Extensive vasogenic edema extendsposteriorly throughout the right temporal lobe and superiorly intothe temporoparietal junction and external capsule. Mass effectincludes effacement of the right temporal horn and medializationof the right uncus without frank herniation.The mass demonstrates elevated relative tumor blood volume onperfusion imaging and also demonstrates an irregular andmicro-lobulated margin with the adjacent temporal lobe indicatingprobable invasion. No definite intraosseous component is present.The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. A right mastoideffusion is present.
IMPRESSION:

1. Limited examination for the purposes of treatment planning.2. Homogeneously enhancing predominantly extra axial masscentered in the anterior right middle cranial fossa. Irregularmargins with the adjacent temporal lobe parenchyma and extensivevasogenic edema. Marked elevation of relative tumor blood volume.Imaging findings are most suggestive of meningioma likely withparenchymal brain invasion. Due to the aggressive appearance atypical meningioma or hemangiopericytoma is favored.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStation
