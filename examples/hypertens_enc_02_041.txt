Diseases: ['rhombencephalitis']
FINDINGS:

The signal intensity of the bone marrow is heterogeneous in all visualized bony structures multiple small T1-dark foci but no focal defined large or expansile lesion. The pattern is nonspecific. Increased intensity in basal ganglia on T1-weighted images bilaterally may reflect prior liver dysfunction given this history. Patchy but relatively symmetric signal abnormality is present in the pons and midbrain not associated with convincing decreased diffusion. No abnormal enhancement. Pons may be very slightly expanded. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. There are additional scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter on long-TR images nonspecific excessive for age. The findings in the brainstem may be related but seem more prominent than supratentorial findings. Extra-axial blood on right seen in March 2011 CT is no longer identified.
IMPRESSION:

1. Patchy signal abnormality in the pons possibly minimally expanded extends into the midbrain but without abnormality in diffusion and without abnormal enhancement. History of liver transplant recent past osmotic demyelination is a consideration although the pattern is not typical for this hypertensive encephalopathy is a consideration but no history of this. Rhombencephalitis is possible though no convincing enhancement. Pattern is not typical for drug toxicity such as from tacrolimus but this is not excluded. It is possible that these are chronic microvascular changes and related to white matter abnormalities elsewhere but brainstem findings seem more prominent than supratentorial findings. 2. Abnormal signal intensity in the bone marrow small T1 dark foci scattered throughout the bone marrow but no dominant or defined expansile mass. Findings could be treatment-related but correlate for potential marrow abnormalities. Discussed with Dr. Yoo in transplant surgery 11/2/2011.
