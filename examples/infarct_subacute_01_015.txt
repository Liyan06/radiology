Diseases: ['infarction', 'infarction']
FINDINGS:

Images are somewhat degraded by patient motion. Multiple punctate foci of restricted diffusion identified within the right thalamus right temporal lobe and bilateral occipital lobes system with acute/subacute infarcts likely embolic or watershed given size and distribution. A larger region of restricted diffusion is present adjacent to the right sylvian fissure also consistent with an acute/subacute infarction. A large region of abnormal signal associated left ventricular dilatation is present within the left temporo-parietal lobe with mildly restricted diffusion consistent with a prior infarction subacute to chronic. Moderate subcortical and periventricular white matter flair hyperintensities are noted this is a nonspecific finding but in this patient's age group commonly associated with chronic small vessel ischemic change. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as the superior sagittal sinus. Mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. Restricted diffusion identified within the right thalamus right temporal lobe and bilateral occipital lobes system with acute/subacute infarcts likely embolic or watershed given size and distribution. A larger region of restricted diffusion is present adjacent to the right sylvian fissure also consistent with an acute infarction. 2. Left temporo-parietal lobe abnormal signal with mildly restricted diffusion consistent with a subacute to chronic infarction. 3. Sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic change. Findings discussed with Dr. Torres of the ER at 4:30 pm on 9/26/10 with readback confirmation.
