Diseases: ['myelinolysis']
FINDINGS:

There is nonspecific ill-defined T2 prolongation in the pons which could be related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes but is more extensive than the more typical small vessel ischemic changes that the patient demonstrates in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. This raises the possibility of a metabolic abnormality such as central pontine myelinolysis clinically correlate. Apparent focal area of T2 prolongation in the right aspect of the posterior medulla (series 3 image 9) is favored to be artifactual as it is not seen on FLAIR or T1. There is global cerebral volume loss nonspecific. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No infarct no intracranial mass or mass-effect. At the right parietal vertex there is a focal osseous lesion which is low in signal on T1 and demonstrates restricted diffusion possibly representing a metastasis (see image 19 of series 2. There is a second osseous and lesion adjacent to the right lambdoid suture on image 14 of series 5. Small focal signal abnormality in the right parietal bone on image 24 series 5. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear except for left maxillary mucous retention cyst. Bilateral lens surgery otherwise the orbits are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonspecific T2 prolongation in the pons out of proportion to chronic small vessel ischemic changes seen above the tentorium. Correlate clinically to exclude metabolic abnormality such as central pontine myelinolysis. 2. Multiple osseous lesions concerning for metastases incompletely evaluated without contrast. Correlate for bone metastases elsewhere. (These areas not within the field of view of PET/CT 3/12/12).
