Diseases: ['medulloblastoma']
FINDINGS:

Status post suboccipital craniectomy with stable cerebellar resection cavity and post-radiation changes. There is stable encephalomalacic changes with increased FLAIR and T2 signal within the bilateral posterior cerebellum with left greater than right mild ex vacuo dilatation of the fourth ventricle and right greater than left cerebellar volume loss. No evidence of abnormal enhancement or change in FLAIR abnormality surrounding the surgical cavity to suggest recurrence. Redemonstrated is increased T2 and FLAIR signal within the right parietal lobe extending to the right occipital horn and likely representing tract of prior ventriculostomy catheter. Redemonstrated are multiple foci of susceptibility within the bilateral cerebral hemisphere and pons which likely represent microhemorrhages versus tiny cavernomas stable. No extra-axial fluid collections or mass effect. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent slightly prominent for patient age. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable. Minimal amount of fluid within bilateral mastoid air cells right greater than left.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable postsurgical/postradiation changes in the cerebellum from prior medulloblastoma resection. No abnormal enhancement surrounding the surgical cavity to suggest recurrence. 2. Stable tiny cavernomas versus microhemorrhages within the bilateral cerebral hemisphere and pons. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
