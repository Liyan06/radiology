Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Post surgical changes are seen midline and right frontal region consistent with prior craniotomy. There is minimal encephalomalacia in the right frontal cortex extending to the level of the lateral ventricles through the corpus callosum where there is a defect. There was an apparent shunt tract in this location previously although ventriculostomy catheter may have been removed since the prior study. Ventricles remain nondilated volume on the left is slightly larger than the right however. The mass in the region of the third ventricle/frame of Munro is no longer visualized. Again seen is a T2-bright minimally heterogeneous nodule centered in the region of the vidian canal on the left (best seen on series 5 image 7) although source of nodule could also be V2 division of cranial nerve V which is slightly prominent compared to right side on this and prior studies. The nodule does appear to minimally enhance. Appearance is stable. Post surgical changes including blood products and edema along the surgical/ventriculostomy path have evolved appropriately since 1/7/06.
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving post surgical changes right frontal region since 1/7/06 mass documented on 1/5/06 exam at level of foramina Munro/third ventricle no longer visualized.2. Enhancing lesion centered along the left vidian nerve stable appearance possibly schwannoma hemangioma or perhaps primary bony lesion. Origin could also be V2 division of cranial nerve 5. CT might be helpful for further evaluation of bony integrity otherwise follow up recommended to insure stability perhaps in about 12 months assuming no symptoms or change referable to this location. An orbits protocol would be better for assessing anatomy in proximity and CT (maxillofacial in axial and coronal planes) would also help in this regard.
