Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Hippocampi are normal in signal and internal architecture and symmetric bilaterally. No intracranial hemorrhage infarct mass or mass effect. Cerebral volume is normal. There is no pathologic enhancement of the parenchyma or meninges. Ventricles are normal in size and configuration. There are approximately 10 small foci of T2 prolongation in the subcortical and deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres nonspecific and of uncertain significance. No foci in the corpus callosum or below the tentorium. Periventricular white matter is fairly normal. The orbits are normal. Sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Hippocampi are symmetric and normal in signal and internal architecture. 2. Approximately 10 small nonspecific foci of T2 prolongation in the white matter of both hemispheres. These are likely age related and of no consequence. 3. Allergic reaction to MultiHance rash on chest and arms which resolved with time and oral Benadryl. No prior history of allergic reaction to MRI contrast patient was asked to call her prior imaging centers to find a brand of contrast which she better tolerated. In the absence of that knowledge consider using Gadovist or Magnevist on future MRIs with or without steroid preparation. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
