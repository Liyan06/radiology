Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Curvature and alignment of the cervical spinal are normal. Vertebral body heights are intact. Mild endplate reactive changes are noted but otherwise there is no focal bone marrow abnormality. The visualized spinal cord is normal in morpholgy and signal intensity. There is no syrinx. There is no cord compression. Mild caudal ectopia of the cerebellar tonsils noted but the tonsils maintain a rounded configuration which would argue against Chiari malformation. Mild ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament is noted. At C2-3 mild disc bulge and uncovertebral hypertrophy noted but no canal or foraminal stenosis. At C3-4 diffuse disc bulge noted with uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet arthropathy. This results in mild canal stenosis and severe right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing. At C4-5 diffuse disc bulge with central osteophyte noted resulting in mild canal stenosis. There is also bilateral uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet arthropathy resulting in moderate right greater than left foraminal narrowing. At C5-6 a tiny central disc protrusion is present with uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet arthropathy bilaterally. This results in very mild canal stenosis with moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing. At C6-7 mild diffuse disc bulge noted with uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet arthropathy bilaterally. No significant canal or foraminal stenosis. At C7 -T1 there is no evidence of disc herniation canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
IMPRESSION:

1. Mild caudal ectopia of the cerebellar tonsils without evidence of Chiari 1 malformation. Cervical spinal cord is normal without evidence of syrinx. 2. Degenerative changes as described resulting in mild canal stenosis and moderate to severe neural foraminal narrowing at several levels as further detailed above.
