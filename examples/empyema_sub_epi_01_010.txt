Diseases: ['empyema']
FINDINGS:

The patient is status post right craniotomy. There remains tumor over the high right parietal region infiltrating the superior sagittal sinus grossly unchanged from the prior examination. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus anterior to the level of infiltration is unchanged. Adjacent to the tumor again noted is a fluid collection which does not fully suppress on flair concerning for neoplastic involvement. Redemonstrated is a subdural collection over the right convexity which is essentially stable size when compared to previous study. In the interval signal characteristics have become more heterogeneous on all sequences and diffusion restriction has become thinner and diminished. Stable enhancement of the adjacent meninges. The fluid collection and extra-axial tumor continues to exert local mass effect on the right cerebral hemisphere but without midline shift. There is mild generalized cerebral volume loss likely treatment related. There is diffuse hyperintensity of the marrow signal on T1-weighted images likely related to the patient's history of whole brain radiation therapy. Overall improved aeration of the paranasal sinuses with small fluid level in the left maxillary sinus. Diminished fluid in the mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right subdural fluid collection which is stable in size with more heterogeneous signal characteristics and diminished diffusion restriction. Stable meningeal enhancement. The findings are nonspecific and may reflect evolving postsurgical changes versus treatment of subdural empyema. Correlate clinically. 2. Unchanged findings of right craniotomy with residual tumor of the high right parietal region with infiltration of the adjacent superior sagittal sinus. Stable fluid collection adjacent to the residual tumor may reflect neoplastic involvement. 3. Paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell fluid accumulation which has significantly improved in the interval since the prior study.
