Diseases: ['sarcoidosis', 'lymphoma', 'germinoma']
FINDINGS:

There is an infiltrating lesion involving the left basal ganglia and left thalamus which is both T2 and T1 hyperintense without associated mass effect. Questionable hazy areas of associated enhancement (series 14 images 18-19 and series 13 images 8-11). A similar T2 and T1 hyperintense lesion but without enhancement is seen tracking along the right medial temporal lobe. There is abnormal enhancement and mild thickening of the left oculomotor nerve as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the adjacent left midbrain. There is also abnormal enhancement of the left CN V and right CN VII/VIII nerve complex. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. No restricted diffusion. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening of bilateral maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells. There is prominence of the posterior aspect of the left inferior turbinate. Evaluation of the orbits shows no retrobulbar mass. There is no T2 signal abnormality or pathologic enhancement along the visualized optic pathways. The extraocular muscles are symmetric in size.
IMPRESSION:

1. There is an infiltrating lesion in the left basal ganglia which is T1 and T2 hyperintense with questionable areas of hazy enhancement. A similar but non-enhancing lesion is seen in the medial right temporal lobe. There is also enhancement of multiple cranial nerves including left CN III left CN V and right CN VII/VIII nerve complex. These findings are non-specific but differential considerations include sarcoidosis lymphoma gliomatosis cerebri with leptomeningeal involvement paraneoplastic syndrome or basal ganglia germinoma with metastatic extension; sarcoid/lymphoma are favored. Recommend further evaluation with advanced imaging. 2. No intra-orbital abnormality. Results were discussed with and acknowledged by Drs. Galetta and Franchette at 5pm on 1/19/09.
