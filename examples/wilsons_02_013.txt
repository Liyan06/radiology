Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

The study is mildly degraded by patient motion artifact. Diagnostic information is still obtainable. There is abnormal restricted diffusion of the right random left hippocampal formations left caudate head right caudate head and body right lentiform nuclei and cortical decreased effusion of the right frontal and temporal and left frontal lobes. Her is no abnormal enhancement in these regions. The findings are associated with increased T2 and flair signal with perhaps mild cortical thickening. The patient is status post left MCA territory infarction with associated encephalomalacia and ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. Encephalomalacia and mild chronic hemorrhage products of the left container also consistent with prior infarction or hematoma. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss appropriate for age. Mild periventricular white matter changes are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal hippocampal cortical and basal ganglia diffusion restriction and signal abnormality without enhancement. These findings are most consistent with a prion disease such as CJD. 2. Chronic encephalomalacia of the left temporal lobe and left basal ganglia consistent with chronic infarctions and bleed. 3. Findings consistent with mild sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. These findings were discussed with and confirmed by Dr. Wilson on March 17 2010 at 22:21.
