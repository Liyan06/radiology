Diseases: ['contusion']
FINDINGS:

Seen more extensively than on the prior head CT of the same day is subarachnoid hemorrhage within sulci bilaterally including the occipital lobes temporoparietal lobes right greater than left as well as frontal and parietal paramedian sulci. Questionable contusion right frontal lobe. No subdural or epidural hemorrhage. Ventricles are stable in size and probably appropriate for degree of parenchynmal volume. No acute infarct. Right paramedian frontal scalp hematoma again seen. MRA demonstrates fenestration of the distal basilar artery but no focal aneurysm is seen. There is normal flow-related enhancement within the circle of Willis and its proximal branches. No focal aneurysm or stenosis. MRV demonstrates patency of the visible superficial and deep venous sinuses. The left transverse sinus is dominant.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI confirms scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage throughout the supratentorial spaces as above. Questionable contusion in the right frontal lobe. 2. No focal aneurysm. Fenestration of the basilar artery distally which increases risk for future aneurysms. 3. No superficial or deep venous sinus thrombosis. Discussed with and acknowledged by Liz Seiter for Brad Lega at 4:50pm on 6/12/09.
