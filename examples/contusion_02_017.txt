Diseases: ['encephalomalacia', 'contusion']
FINDINGS:

There are no areas of restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. There is an area of encephalomalacia in the right lateral temporal lobe in the area prior to hemorrhagic contusion. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in size and configuration. The orbital contents are normal. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. Mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus. There is irregularity of the cervical carotid arteries bilaterally which may represent fibromuscular dysplasia. MRA of the circle of Willis shows no evidence of intracranial stenosis occlusion or aneurysm. MRA of the cervical vessels shows normal course of the carotid and vertebral arteries from their origins to the intracranial portions.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute ischemia. No findings suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 2. Irregularity of the cervical carotid arteries bilaterally suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia. 3. Area of encephalomalacia in the right lateral temporal lobe in the area of previously seen hemorrhagic contusion. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agree with this report.
