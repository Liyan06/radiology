Diseases: ['astrocytoma', 'lymphoma', 'abscess', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is a large heterogeneous intraaxial mass (measuring approximately 7 cm in greatest axial dimension) centered within the left frontal periventricular white matter with local sulcal effacement significant mass effect on the frontal horn and body of the left lateral ventricle left to right midline shift of 15 mm and possibly subfalcine herniation. There is mild asymmetric prominence of the body occipital horn and temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. Basal cisterns are patent. The lesion appears to contain both cellular and cystic components contains high T1 signal intensity possibly blood products and demonstrates mild internal patchy enhancement. The lesion also demonstrates a thin diffuse enhancing rim. The more solid component of the lesion demonstrates restricted diffusion and elevtaed rCBV. There is minimal surrounding high flair/T2 signal abnormality. No other intracranial lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION:

1. Heterogeneous probable intraaxial mass centered in the left frontal lobe with mixed cellular and cystic components possible internal blood products and mild internal patchy enhancement. Differential considerations include a primary glial neoplasm given the elevated rCBV an atypical GBM or anaplastic astrocytoma would be most likely. Age of the patient is atypical for a pleomorphic xanthroastrocytoma. The appearance is atypical for lymphoma or abscess. While this is favored to be an intra-axial mass differential considerations for an extra-axial mass would include an atypical meningioma. 2. Significant mass effect associated with the left frontal lobe mass with 15 mm left-to-right midline shift significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and mild asymmetric prominence of the right lateral ventricle. Please note that MR spectroscopy could not be completed due to technical failure. The patient will return for this portion of the exam at no additional charge.
