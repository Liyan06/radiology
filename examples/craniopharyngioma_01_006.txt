Diseases: ['craniopharyngioma']
FINDINGS:

There is 6 x 7 x 10 mm predominantly suprasellar midline mass which demonstrates mild peripheral enhancement most prominently at around its posterior and lateral aspects and appears to arise from the pituitary stalk. While the internal contents are T2 hyperintense they do not completely suppress on FLAIR imaging indicative of underlying proteinaceous components. This mass closely abuts and may contact the optic chiasm which does not appear thinned. There is mild heterogeneous enhancement of the sellar contents without discrete hypoenhancing foci which can be confirmed in two planes; the single largest of these in hypoenhancing foci measures up to 4 mm in maximal diameter. There is no restricted diffusion.No extraaxial fluid collectionsNo focal regions of mass effect. Multiple punctate FLAIR hyperintensities are noted within the right frontal subcortical and deep white matter which are nonspecific. No suspicious parenchymal or meningeal enhancement. No midline shift. No ventriculomegaly. The imaged intracranial vascular flow voids are within normal limits. Ethmoidal mucosal changes. Probable sphenoid sinus mucous retention cyst. The right maxillary sinus appears somewhat hypoplastic.
IMPRESSION:

1. Approximately 1 cm predominately suprasellar cystic appearing mass which appears to arise from the pituitary stalk. Differential considerations would include a Rathke cleft cyst versus less likely craniopharyngioma. Correlation with prior MRI would be helpful to assess for stability. Correlation with prior CT to assess for calcification would be helpful. 2. Heterogeneous enhancing appearance the pituitary with multiple hypoenhancing foci which cannot be confidently confirmed in two planes. The largest diameter of these hypoenhancing foci measures up to 4 mm.
