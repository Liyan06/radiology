Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

Axial T2-weighted and postcontrast T1-weighted images are motion degraded. Study was terminated at this point due to patient's symptoms of chest pain. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There are numerous foci and confluent areas of T2 prolongation within the subcortical periventricular and deep white matter and to a lesser extent the brainstem and cerebellum. In addition small focal hyperintensities are noted in the bilateral basal ganglia. These findings are likely reflective of chronic ischemic change is with component of hypertensive changes. There is an area of T2 prolongation and patchy enhancement within the right frontal lobe likely related to subacute infarction. No restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. There are numerous areas of susceptibility within the bilateral basal ganglia thalami brainstem and cerebellar hemispheres. In addition to a lesser extent a few foci of susceptibility are noted within the bilateral cerebral hemispheres peripherally. Overall this is more suggestive of a hypertensive pattern of microhemorrhages. Mild maxillary sinus mucosal changes. The common carotid arteries common carotid bifurcations and cervical internal carotid arteries are patent bilaterally. The cervical vertebral arteries are patent bilaterally. The right vertebral artery is hypoplastic. No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis within the neck. Within the partially evaluated intracranial circulation there is stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery as noted on previous angiogram dated 4/28/2009.
IMPRESSION:

1. Patency of the neck vasculature. 2. Extensive chronic ischemic changes with hypertensive pattern of chronic microhemorrhages. 3. Small area of T2 prolongation and patchy enhancement within the right frontal lobe likely related to subacute infarction. No evidence of acute infarction.
