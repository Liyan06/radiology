Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Again noted are multiple hemorrhages in the brain in the right temporal lobe and bilateral frontal lobes. Mild amount of surrounding edema relatively little mass effect. No abnormal parenchymal enhancement. Suggestion of bilateral dural enhancement. A small subdural collection is noted over the left occipital convexity maybe 2 mm in thickness stable. Encephalomalacia in right caudate head right cerebellar peduncle. Extensive white matter changes likely chronic ischemic change. Right maxillary and right ethmoid sinuses remain opacified. Sphenoid sinus is hypoplastic. Bilateral lens surgery.
IMPRESSION:

1. The multifocal hemorrhages likely represent traumatic contusions. 2. Stable subdural hematoma over the left occipital convexity. 3. Chronic ischemic changes as above.
