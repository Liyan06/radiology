Diseases: ['migraine']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple hyperintensities on long-TR images in the deep and subcortical white matter to a lesser extent periventricular regions. These number more than 9 in total no convincing infratentorial lesions. On sagittal FLAIR images there are no clear callosal-septal lesions. No enhancing lesions. Ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and age-appropriate. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. In the cervical spine there is degenerative disc disease at C5-6 C6-7 and C7-T1. There is minimal spinal stenosis at these levels but no convincing cord impingement or signal abnormality. There is a small paramedian disc protrusion on the left at C7-T1 which just touches anterior surface of cord. Possible hemangioma is noted in C5 versus focal fat. No abnormal enhancement. Thoracic cord is within normal limits in size and signal intensity. Small disc bulges/protrusions are seen at many levels none of which significantly impinge upon spinal canal. There is a probable small right renal cyst. No abnormal enhancement.
IMPRESSION:

1. Greater than 9 small white matter hyperintensities supratentorial regions nonspecific pattern. Differential diagnosis is broad and includes diverse etiologies such as demyelinating processes and other inflammatory disorders small vessel ischemic changes migraine headaches among others. 2. Degenerative changes cervical spine as described above with mild spinal stenosis but no convincing cord abnormality or enhancement. 3. Unremarkable thoracic spine and cord except for multi-level degenerative changes without significant narrowing of spinal canal no abnormal enhancement.
