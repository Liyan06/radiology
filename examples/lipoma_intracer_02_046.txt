Diseases: ['lipoma']
FINDINGS:

Postoperative changes related to transsphenoidal surgery is demonstrated including fluid in paranasal sinuses associated with mucosal thickening and enhancement of mucosa. Minimal amount of fluid is demonstrated in the nasopharynx. The previously mentioned focus of differential decreased enhancement in the right side of the pituitary gland is not appreciated in the current study. There has been improvement in the previously visualized superior convexity of the pituitary gland. The pituitary infundibulum which was previously deviated slightly to the left side is also back to midline in the current study. A small area of heterogeneity is again demonstrated in the left side of the adenohypophysis best seen on series 8 image 10 uncertain significance could also be artefactual. There is redemonstration of focus of T1 hyperintensity superior to the dorsum sella with signal characteristics consistent with the fat in all pulse sequences indicative of lipoma. Otherwise in the brain right lateral ventricle is a little larger than left but this is within normal limits of variation area temporal horns nondilated. The ventricles and CSF spaces are otherwise symmetric and appropriate for age. No suspicious foci of abnormal increased or decreased signal intensity in the brain and no acute findings on diffusion-weighted images. No abnormal parenchymal enhancement. Visualized portions of orbits within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:

1. Postoperative changes related to transsphenoidal surgery as described. No definite area of differential hypoenhancement is noted to suggest residual adenoma. See above. 2. Subcentimeter suprasellar lipoma unchanged. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
