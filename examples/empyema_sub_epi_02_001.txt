Diseases: ['empyema', 'hydrocephalus', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Again today's study is degraded by motion. Pre-contrast FLAIR imaging which was not part of the prior imaging protocol demonstrates diffuse right hemispheric failure of subarachnoid space fluid suppression. There is increased prominence of diffuse right hemispheric subdural space restricted diffusion suggesting the possibility of a small subdural abscess but after accounting for differences in technique this is not significantly worsened compared to the study of April 29.. Postcontrast images again demonstrate diffuse predominately right-sided pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement without clear evidence of a focal loculated fluid collection. Redemonstrated is mild sulcal swelling in the right superior hemisphere. Redemonstrated are numerous foci of T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular subcortical and deep white matter as well as in the central pons likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic changes unchanged from prior study. Again noted is diffuse marked ventriculomegaly and prominence of the extra-axial spaces. The basal cisterns are patent. The intracranial flow voids are normal. The calvarium is normal. Status post bilateral lens replacement. The paranasal sinuses are clear. Redemonstrated is opacification of the right greater than left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings suggestive of a thin right-sided subdural empyema see above. 2. Stable ventriculomegaly. It is unclear to what extent this reflects parenchymal volume loss versus communicating hydrocephalus but in light of the extensive meningeal changes and abnormal subarachnoid space there seems likely to be a component of communicating hydrocephalus. Findings discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Jia of the neurology service at 11:55 p.m. 5/5/2012.
