FINDINGS:

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. There is probably a small arachnoid cyst over the medial right frontal parietal convexity. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. No restricted diffusion. Evaluation of the internal auditory canals and cerebello-pontine angles bilaterally shows no mass or pathologic enhancement. Bilateral orbits are unremarkable. There is mucosal thickening involving bilateral maxillary and anterior ethmoidal air cells. The MR angiogram demonstrates unremarkable bilateral petrous cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid arteries. The visualized bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries are also unremarkable. Posteriorly bilateral terminal vertebral basilar artery and its branches are unremarkable. The right PICA is not visualized however a dominant left PICA is seen likely an anatomic variant. On the MR venogram a hypoplastic but patent right transverse sinus is seen. The superior sagittal left transverse and bilateral sigmoid sinuses are patent. The patent straight sinus is noted.
IMPRESSION:

1. No mass or pathologic enhancement in the internal auditory canals or cerebello-pontine angles. No intracranial mass lesion. 2. Unremarkable MR angiogram of the intracranial circulation. Please note that if the patient has objective pulsatile tinnitus conventional angiogram may be warrented; clinically correlate. 3. Hypoplastic right transverse sinus normal anatomic variant. The superior sagittal left transverse and bilateral sigmoid sinuses are patent.
