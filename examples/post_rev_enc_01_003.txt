Diseases: ['infarction', 'hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Interval development of multiple FLAIR hyperintensities in the subcortical white matter predominantly in the posterior temporal lobes parietal lobes as well involving the cerebellar hemisphere pons and basal ganglia. These areas have no appreciable restricted diffusion or blooming artifact on gradient echo imaging. Findings are in keeping with PRES. In the left frontal subcortical white matter there is a stable focus of restricted diffusion in keeping with acute infarction (image 88/2) unchanged. New small foci of restricted diffusion in the left caudate nucleus and white matter of both cerebral hemispheres consistent with acute infarction. Stable subdural hematoma present in the right posterior convexity and a larger one over the left convexity. Subarachnoid FLAIR hyperintensity is also present over the left convexity which may represent subarachnoid hemorrhage. These findings are grossly stable since most recent prior MRI.
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive white matter FLAIR hyperintensity in the bilateral parietal lobes posterior temporal lobes pons cerebellum and basal ganglia. These lesions do not demonstrate restricted diffusion. Findings most in keeping with PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). 2. Foci of acute ischemic infarction in the left frontal white matter unchanged. New small foci of restricted diffusion in the left caudate nucleus and white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. No intracranial hemorrhage. 3. Stable left subdural collection and FLAIR hyperintensity in left subarachnoid spaces. 4. Status post right craniotomy changes with stable small right subdural hematoma.
