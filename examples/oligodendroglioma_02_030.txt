Diseases: ['oligodendroglioma', 'astrocytoma']
FINDINGS:

There is a mildly heterogeneous mass within the left frontal lobe extending across the genu of the corpus callosum into the right frontal lobe. There are areas of gray matter involvement most notably in the medial left frontal lobe where there is gyral expansion. There is expansion of the genu of the corpus callosum. There are some small areas of internal cystic change. A few small areas of low signal in the mass may represent calcifications. There is associated mass effect with effacement of the left frontal cortical sulci and effacement of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally. There is a small amount of patchy restricted diffusion within the lesion. Following contrast administration there is a small nodular focus of enhancement within the medial left frontal lobe (image 103 series 14). No acute intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial fluid collection or midline shift. The basal cisterns are patent. MR perfusion imaging demonstrates patchy areas of increased relative cerebral blood volume within the mass. MR spectroscopy within the lesion demonstrates elevated choline and decreased NAA peaks within the left frontal lobe mass and within the corpus callosal and right frontal lobe extension. There is mild mucosal thickening within the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left frontal lobe mass with extension into the genu of the corpus callosum and crossing midline into the right frontal lobe. Conventional and advanced imaging findings are consistent with a high-grade glial tumor such as an anaplastic oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma. There is a small focus of enhancement in the medial left frontal lobe.
