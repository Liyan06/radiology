Diseases: ['meningitis', 'cerebritis']
FINDINGS:

MRI Brain: Ventricles and sulci are age-appropriate. The right mastoid air cells are opacified. There are signal changes in the right temporal lobe on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. With contrast mild dural enhancement is noted underneath the right temporal lobe. A left middle cranial fossa arachnoid cyst is again noted. No abnormal restricted diffusion. The blood in subarachnoid spaces and cisterns was better seen on prior CT. No parenchymal hemorrhage. MRA head: The intracranial circulation is patent. No evidence of occlusion aneurysm or significant stenosis. No abnormal vasculature to suggest a vascular malformation. MRA neck: The bilateral carotid and vertebral arteries are patent. No evidence of aneurysm occlusion or significant stenosis. No evidence of dissection. Common origin of the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries a normal variant. The left vertebral artery is dominant. MRI neck: The nasopharynx oropharynx and oral cavity are within normal limits. The larynx vocal cords and trachea are normal. There is no evidence of significant lymphadenopathy. The salivary glands are normal. The thyroid gland is normal. The lung apices are clear. Incidental note of degenerative changes in the cervical spine incompletely evaluated. Sternotomy wires.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of carotid or vertebral artery dissection. No evidence of aneurysm. 2. Right mastoid opacification with dural enhancement and parenchymal signal abnormality in the right temporal lobe. While the temporal lobe signal changes might have represented volume averaging with the adjacent mastoid opacification the dural enhancement cannot be so explained as artifact. The findings are therefore concerning for meningitis and possible cerebritis. Correlation with lumbar puncture suggested. Findings discussed with Dr. Levine at 1:15 pm on 5/23/08.
