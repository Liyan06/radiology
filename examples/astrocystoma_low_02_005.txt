Diseases: ['oligodendroglioma']
FINDINGS:

In the superomedial portion of the rightfrontal/parietal lobe in the region of the central sulcus thereis a lobulated well circumscribed 1.9 (AP) x 2.1 (TR) x 3.1(craniocaudal) intra-axial mass. It demonstrates heterogenoussignal T2 hyperintensity and heterogeneous enhancement. There isno midline shift associated with this mass. There is minimaleffacement of the adjacent sulci.There are no other signal abnormalities or pathologic enhancementin the remainder of the brain parenchyma.Diffusion weighted imaging demonstrates no acute ischemia.Gradient echo images showed no significant hemosiderin deposition.Imaging of the temporal lobes show the bilateral hippocampalstructures to be symmetric and within normal limits for size andmorphology. There is no abnormal signal intensity or pathologicenhancement.There is minimal mucosal thickening of the bilateral maxillarysinuses left greater than right. The remainder the paranasalsinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Approximately 2-3 cm lobulated well circumscribed heterogeneous mass in the right frontal/parietal lobe withoutsignificant surrounding mass effect as described above. Findingssuggestive of a low-grade glioma possibly oligodendroglioma organglioglioma.These findings were discussed with Dr. Amy Pruitt at 10:56 AM on3/15/06.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
