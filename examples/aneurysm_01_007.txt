Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

At the A2-A3 junction of the right ACA there is a round 8mm mass which is incompletely characterized. There is low signal peripherally on the susceptibility weighted sequence and T2 weighted sequence which could represent hemosiderin. While this could be a vascular loop the appearance raises concern for saccular aneurysm recommend CT arteriogram. Other considerations would include a partially calcified meningioma. I think is unlikely to be a cavernoma based on its extra-axial location. Because of its proximity to the intracerebral arteries however a slow flow or partially occluded aneurysm seems a reasonable consideration. Hippocampi are symmetric and normal in internal architecture and signal. Asymmetry of the forniceal columns correlates with asymmetric size of the lateral ventricles normal variant. Mammillary bodies are normal. No intracranial hemorrhage infarct mass or mass effect. Cerebral volume is normal for age. No restricted diffusion. Normal pattern of iron deposition in the basal ganglia. Focus of abnormal susceptibility in the right centrum semi-ovale is nonspecific most often related to chronic hypertensive microhemorrhage. There is opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. The nasopharyngeal mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Correlate for otomastoiditis.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal structure 8mm in size adjacent to the A2-A3 segment concerning for aneurysm recommend CTA. An immediate post CTA enhanced CT of the brain would be of value. 2. Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification correlate for otomastoiditis and consider follow up scan. 3. No evidence of acute ischemia mammillary body atrophy or structural abnormality.
