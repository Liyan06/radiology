Diseases: ['gliosis']
FINDINGS:

There is stable T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in subcortical high right greater than left frontal lobe white matter as well as the left parietal white matter possibly involving the left parietal grey matter. There is stable mild prominence of the extraaxial CSF spaces normal in signal intensity. No abnormally restricted diffusion. No abnormal parenchymal enhancement. There is stable mild-moderate dural enhancement predominantly involving the bifrontal regions. There is stable prominence of the pituitary gland extending into the suprasellar region with mass not excluded. There are postsurgical changes in left frontal cranium with stable susceptibility artifact in the left frontal scalp and left frontal bone. MR angiography of the circle of Willis is stable from the prior study with diffuse multifocal irregular vascular narrowing. In particular there is minimal-moderate narrowing of the left M1 and M2 segments and left M3 branches. In addition there is minimal narrowing of the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery and right M1 segment. There is diffuse multifocal narrowing of the posterior cerebral arteries. No definite aneurysm. There is a hypoplastic left P1 segment normal variant with left sided posterior fetal circulation. There is hypoplasia or absence of the right A1 segment and right posterior communicating artery.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable brain MRI and MRA compared to the prior study; see above. 2. Stable gliosis in both frontal and parietal lobes right greater than left of uncertain etiology. Stable mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. 3. Stable prominence of pituitary gland extending into suprasellar region with mass lesion not excluded. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
