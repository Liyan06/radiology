Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

On T2-weighted images there are multiple foci of abnormal increased signal intensity in subcortical regions and especially white matter some with associated encephalomalacia also involving anterior temporal white matter bilaterally. Hyperintensity is also evident in brainstem. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. There is asymmetric volume loss in region of left anterior basal ganglia probably prior hemorrhagic insult in past findings concordant with comparison CT. Ventricles and CSF spaces are otherwise nearly symmetric and minimally prominent top normal vs. minimally increased for stated age of 80. Mesial temporal volumes are concordant with prominence of CSF spaces elsewhere with moderate prominence of temporal horns. There appears to be minimal hemosiderin associated with left anterior basal ganglia encephalomalacic area (not calcified on CT). There is another small focus of susceptibility in the right parietal lobe consistent with microhemorrhage or possibly and amyloid angiopathy could also represent a small cavernoma. No acute findings on diffusion-weighted orator images.
IMPRESSION:

1. Hyperintensities white matter and to a lesser extent deep gray matter structures most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes and probable left basal ganglionic chronic hemorrhage. Anterior temporal white matter hyperintensities are less typical and other etiologies are not excluded including other vasculopathies inflammatory processes and otherws. Findings are concordant with comparison CT 4/10/2008 2. Volume loss which is top normal and perhaps minimally increased for age with ex vacuo dilatation left lateral ventricle associate with prior anterior basal ganglionic hemorrhage but also with moderate prominence of temporal horns which is likely concordant with volume loss elsewhere. Correlate clinically.
