Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Please note that the current examination is somewhat degraded by patient motion artifact. There is moderately diffuse cerebral volume loss which probably within normal limits for the patient's stated age. Scattered periventricular and the deep white matter FLAIR hyperintensity is nonspecific but probably the sequela of chronic microangiopathic changes. There is an old lacunar stroke within the left thalamus. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is no restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia/infarct. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. There is fluid layering within the right sphenoid sinus. There is a probable small retention cyst within the left sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia/infarct. 2. Moderately diffuse cerebral volume loss which probably within normal limits for the patient's stated age. Probable sequela of chronic microangiopathic changes. Old lacunar stroke within the left thalamus. 3. Fluid layering within the right sphenoid sinus; correlate for acute sinusitis. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I agree with the preliminary report with the following clarification. The patient is reportedly HIV positive. There is no definite evidence of viral encephalitis or opportunistic infection or neoplasm. There is faint enhancement within the left thalamic probably ischemic lesion.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
