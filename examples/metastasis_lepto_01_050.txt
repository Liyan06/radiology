Diseases: ['metastasis']
FINDINGS:

There is no restricted diffusion in the brain. No mass lesions. There is no abnormal enhancement. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. No extraaxial collection. The intracranial flow voids are normal. There are multiple small foci of increased T2 signal intensity in the periventricular deep white matter and subcortical white matter that are nonspecific but may reflect sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. There is relatively decreased T1 signal intensity of visualized calvarium. This is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in association with anemia other myeloproliferative disorders infiltrative processes including metastasis and chronic hypoxic state including smoking. Clinical correlation is recommended. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral frontoethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction. 2. Relatively decreased T1 signal intensity of visualized calvarium. This is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in association with anemia other myeloproliferative disorders infiltrative processes including metastasis and chronic hypoxic state including smoking. Clinical correlation is recommended. 3. It must be mentioned that due to lack of contrast administration the diagnostic yield of this study for evaluation of intracranial metastases especially leptomeningeal is limited however no gross evidence of intracranial metastases is noted in the available images. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the preliminary report without modification.
