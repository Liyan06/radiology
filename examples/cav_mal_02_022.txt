Diseases: ['infarction', 'lymphoma']
FINDINGS:

The study is motion degraded. There is diffuse hyperintense FLAIR signal within the cerebral sulci bilaterally most likely related to known patient intubation and oxygenation. There are small areas of T2 prolongation and associated restricted diffusion within the high right frontal lobe near the vertex within the splenium of the corpus callosum and within the right medial cerebellum concerning for acute or early subacute infarctions. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extra axial fluid collection mass effect or midline shift. There are diffuse paranasal sinus mucosal changes with small fluid levels in the bilateral maxillary sinuses and a left maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst. The mastoid air cells are opacified bilaterally. There is partial visualization of an oral route and a nasal route tube. The cervical vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. There is mild heterogeneous bone marrow signal nonspecific. There are mild cervical spondylotic changes without significant neural foraminal narrowing or central canal stenosis. There is no definite abnormal signal within the cervical spinal cord although the images are motion degraded.
IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse hyperintense FLAIR signal within the cerebral sulci bilaterally most likely related to known patient intubation and oxygenation. This however remains nonspecific and can be also seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage or infection. 2. Probable small foci of acute or early subacute infarction in the right frontal lobe splenium of the corpus callosum and right cerebellum. This may be embolic in nature. Also correlate for any recent trauma. Neoplastic etiologies such as lymphoma or infectious etiologies are not excluded but are felt to be less likely. Enhanced study could better evaluate. 3. No significant cervical spondyloarthropathy or definite cord signal abnormality.
