Diseases: ['meningioma', 'vasculitis/vasculopathy']
FINDINGS:

That seen on FLAIR images there is hyperintense signal in the right frontal and left frontal sulci consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage as described on recent CT head. In addition there is abnormal increased signal intensity favoring the cortex and to a lesser extent the subcortical white matter in the parasagittal pattern frontal parietal and to a lesser extent occipital lobes. There is also abnormal increased signal intensity in right anterior basal ganglia compared to left and a few small foci of subcortical hyperintensity in the deep white matter to a lesser extent yet. Diffusion is slightly increased in these regions. Ventricles and cisterns are symmetric and normal in size. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified both venous and arterial. Post-contrast T1-weighted images do not show abnormal meningeal enhancement. They do however show a small extra-axial mass right cerebellopontine angle extending slightly into the right internal auditory canal dural-based and most consistent with meningioma this measures about 10 mm in diameter and height about 5 mm. This does not exert substantial mass effect at this time. Post-contrast flair images do show some apparent enhancement and sulci most evident right greater than left parasagittal regions where there are cortical abnormalities. This could indicate meningeal inflammation. Gradient echo images do confirm a minimal amount of blood concordant with recent CT head.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings of subarachnoid hemorrhage bilateral frontal regions are verified. In addition there are cortical signal abnormalities in parasagittal distribution bilaterally also involving right anterior basal ganglia without diffusion abnormalities. There may be some meningeal or inflammation associated with these findings seen only on post-contrast FLAIR images. Differential diagnosis includes vasculopathy/vasculitis posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome correlate for hypertensive episode (including eclampsia) consider also toxins or drugs including cyclosporine or recreational drugs. 2. Small 5 mm(height) x10mm (base) right cerebellopontine angle meningioma extending slightly into internal auditory canal without substantial mass effect. Addendum: Additional history obtained from Dr. Levine who relates CSF negative for white cells (though positive for red cells) elevated ESR at around 50 and no history of immune suppressive drugs. Correlate for vasculitis/vasculopathy consider conventional angiography.
