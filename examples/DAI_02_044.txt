Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple small foci of hemorrhage most numerous in the frontal lobes but also involving the temporal lobes and left parietal lobe; the largest hemorrhage is in the left temporal lobe. There is mild edema associated with many of these hemorrhages greatest in the left temporal lobe. There are several foci of increased T2 signal not associated with hemorrhage including lesions in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum and several subcortical lesions. These findings are likely manifestations of parenchymal contusions and diffuse axonal injury. There is no definite abnormal enhancement in the brain. There are changes related to hemorrhage about a prior right frontal craniotomy tract which are stable compared to the prior CT. A small associated right frontal epidural collection is present and likely stable. A left frontal ventriculostomy catheter is present with tip in the right lateral ventricle also stable. There is a small amount of gas on the right related to the shunt procedures. The ventricles are normal in size and shape. The vascular flow voids are unremarkable. There is fluid in the mastoid air cells. There is mucosal disease in the sphenoid and frontal sinuses and several ethmoid air cells. The known base of skull fractures are not well visualized on the current study. MRI of the cervical spine shows normal alignment and no evidence of fracture. The vertebral body and intervertebral disc height and signal are normal. The spinal cord is normal. There is no spinal cord hemorrhage. There is no spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. No MR evidence of ligamentous injury.
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered foci of hemorrhage and T2 abnormalities involving the frontal and temporal lobes and corpus callosum likely combination of parenchymal contusions and diffuse axonal injury. 2. Changes from ventriculostomy placement. 3. Normal cervical spinal cord and cervical spine.
