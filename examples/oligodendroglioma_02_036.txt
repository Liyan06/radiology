Diseases: ['oligodendroglioma']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is a T2 hyperintense nonenhancing lesion within the right posterior inferior parietal lobe which measures approximately 3.3 cm 2.2 cm x 1.1 cm (AP x TR x CC). This lesion essentially unchanged in size and signal characteristics when compared to the prior study. There is minimal associated mass effect evidenced by effacement of the adjacent sulci. There is no midline shift or herniation. The lesion does not demonstrate susceptibility artifact on the GRE sequence. No additional areas of parenchymal signal abnormality are appreciated. There is no abnormal enhancement. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain. The ventricles and sulci are appropriate for the patient's stated age. No extraaxial collection. The calvarium is unremarkable.The orbits are normal. On the outside imaging study there is suggestion of abnormal T2 prolongation within the right optic nerve There is partial opacification of the posterior left ethmoid air cells otherwise the paranasal sinuses are essentially clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonenhancing cortical/subcortical posteroinferior right parietal lobe mass lesion measuring up to 3.3 cm essentially unchanged from prior examination dated 7/5/2013. Suggestion of abnormal signal within the right optic nerve on the outside study. Consider inflammatory etiology such as demyelination. Recommend clinical correlation and CSF sampling. 2. Additional differential considerations include low-grade neoplasm such as low-grade glioma or oligodendroglioma. Further evaluation with advanced imaging can be obtained as clinically indicated. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
