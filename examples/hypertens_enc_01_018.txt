Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

MRI: The hemorrhage of the posteromedial left temporal lobe is seen in the region blooming artifact on the gradient echocardiogram sequences. There are multiple additional foci of susceptibility on the gradient sequences in both cerebral hemispheres left greater than right as well as the cerebellar hemispheres again left greater than right and the left caudate body. There is no midline shift mass effect extra-axial collection hydrocephalus or infarct. Periventricular white matter signal alteration seen on the T2 and FLAIR sequences is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change. There is generalized cerebral atrophy with prominence of the ventricles and sulci concordant with the patient's age. Appropriate flow voids at the skull base and in the superior sagittal sinus. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The pharyngeal soft tissues and orbital structures are unremarkable. There are no bony lesions. MRA: The MR angiogram is limited by patient motion artifact. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis seen. There may be a 3 mm aneurysm at the basilar tip however this may represent volume averaging or motion artifact. Please note MRA is less sensitive than conventional angiography for small aneurysms.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple foci of susceptibility artifact in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres as detailed above. This is most consistent with the chronic findings of hypertensive encephalopathy. 2. Generalized cerebral atrophy and periventricular white matter signal alteration consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change. 3. Question of small basilar tip aneurysm. These findings were discussed with and confirmed by Dr. Hassan on August 19 2009 at 21:50.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
