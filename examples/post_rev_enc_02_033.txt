Diseases: ['hemangiopericytoma', 'encephalomalacia', 'infarction']
FINDINGS:

Post-operative changes from [biparietal] craniotomy with bifrontal epidural collections. Probable post-operative encephalomalacia in right frontal lobe. There are also enhancing mass lesions at the medial and anterior surfaces of the right frontal lobe consistent with recurrent/residual tumor. The largets mass at the superolateral frontal convexity has slightly increased in size from 13 to 15 mm craniocaudally. The other masses along the medial and lateral surfaces are similar in size. Of note the masses have significantly increased from the prior study of 5/1/09 where the superolateral mass measured 5 mm. Encephalomalacia and laminar neccrosis in left parietal and occipital lobes consistent with prior infarction also extending to the left frontal lobe superiorly. Previously noted areas of signal abnormality in the cerebellum have normalized consistent with PRES that has resolved. Few punctate foci of GRE signal loss bilaterally in the cerebrum and cerebellum may represent prior hemorrhages. No new areas of signal abnormality or abnormal restricted diffusion. With contrast there is some enhancement in the left occipito-temporal lobe consistent with subacute infarction. [Enhancement also noted in the right pons]. Developmental venous anomaly in right temporal lobe. Abnormal signal in left globe probably artifact due to nearby susceptibility effects but clinical correlation is suggested. Mucosal changes in right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Post-operative changes from resection of hemangiopericytoma with slight progressive increase in size of recurrent/residual tumor. 2. Continued evolution of PRES changes in the posterior brain with resolution of cerebellar abnormality. The parieto-occipito-temporal abnormalities have evolved into encephalomalacia. There is some enhancement in the right pons and left occipito-temporal lobe perhaps subacute infarction.
