There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluidcollection mass effect or shift of midline. The ventricularsystem is normal in size and position. The right cerebellar tonsilextends 6.5 mm below the level of the foramen magnum. CSF spacesaround the foramen magnum are normal.The intracranial carotid and vertebral arteries are normal incourse and caliber. There is no evidence of aneurysms orhemodynamically significant stenosis. There is mild narrowing ofthe proximal basilar artery likely due to atherosclerosis.Incidental note is made of a small venous angioma in the leftcentrum semiovale.
