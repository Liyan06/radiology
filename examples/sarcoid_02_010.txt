Diseases: ['meningioma', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There is a 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm (AP x TR x CC) homogeneously enhancing extraaxial mass overlying the anterior medial right frontal convexity with resultant surrounding vasogenic edema. There is increased signal on diffusion weighted images. Findings are consistent with a meningioma. The mass abuts the superior sagittal sinus and it is difficult to assess whether the mass invades the sagittal sinus. On sagittal T1 images no abnormal increased signal within the superior sagittal sinus to suggest thrombus. On postcontrast images there is suggestion of contrast enhancement within the sagittal sinus at the level of the mass. There is no acute transcortical infarct. There is mild leftward midline shift of 2-3 mm. No evidence of acute hydrocephalus. Ventricular system appears patent. Basal cisterns patent. No extraaxial collection. Partially empty sella is noted with suggestion of small cerebral sulci. The calvarium is unremarkable.The orbits are unremarkable. No radiographic evidence of papilledema.
IMPRESSION:

1. 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm enhancing extra axial mass overlying the anterior medial right frontal convexity with surrounding vasogenic edema. Findings are consistent with a meningioma. The mass abuts the superior sagittal sinus. Further evaluation with MRV to assess patency of the superior sagittal sinus can be obtained as clinically indicated. 2. Partially empty sella. Suggestion of small cerebral sulci which may be within normal limits in this young patient however consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Correlate clinically.
