Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

There are several nonspecific scattered foci of increased signal intensity within the deep and subcortical white matter without associated mass effect. Following contrast administration none demonstrate enhancement. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. Mild diffuse decreased calvarial marrow T1 signal intensity. Superimposed on this is a region of T1- and T2-signal hyperintensity in the right temporal bone (series 3 image 14 series 2 image 22); there may be minimal expansion. Evaluation of the cervical and thoracic spine demonstrates reversal of cervical lordosis. There is grade I anterolisthesis of C7 on T1. There are multilevel spondylotic changes in the cervical spine with central disc osteophyte complexes at the C3 through C7 levels with mild central canal stenosis but no significant mass effect on the cord. No focal aggressive marrow lesions are identified. The cervical and thoracic spinal cord are normal in contour. T2-weighted images show linear hyperintensity in the cord extending from C2-C3 to C5 level likely representing a syrinx. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. No definite signal abnormality is visualized in the thoracic cord.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonspecific foci of signal abnormality in cerebral white matter. Differential diagnosis includes but is not limited to demyelinating process Lyme disease sarcoidosis and vascular etiologies. Comparison to any prior exams may be helpful. 2. No cord signal abnormality. 3. Probable hemangioma right temporal bone; advise correlation with CT with bone-algorithm reconstruction. 4. Calvarial marrow findings are nonspecific but are suggestive of a hematologic disorder such as chronic anemia.
