Diseases: ['meningitis']
FINDINGS:

The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. There is no parenchymal mass hemorrhage or midline shift. No extra-axial fluid collection is present. Diffusion weighted imaging demonstrates no acute infarct. There are scattered foci of T2 prolongation within the subcortical and periventricular white matter nonspecific in etiology. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. There is CSF flair hyperintensity involving several occipital sulci bilaterally with an appearance and distribution not typical for leptomeningeal metastases or meningitis. Findings are non-specific and may be artifactual or related to slow flow within blood vessels. Attention to this region of follow-up imaging is advised. Expected flow voids of the major intracranial vessels are present at the skull base. The visualized orbits paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. No convincing evidence of metastatic disease to the brain and its coverings. 2. Nonspecific white matter foci of signal abnormality. No associated enhancement. 3. CSF flair hyperintensity involving several occipital sulci bilaterally with an appearance and distribution not typical for leptomeningeal metastases or meningitis. Findings are non-specific and may be artifactual or related to slow flow within blood vessels. Attention to this region of follow-up imaging is advised. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I agree with the preliminary report without modification. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
