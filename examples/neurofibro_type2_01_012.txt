Diseases: ['schwannoma', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Stable appearance of bilateral cerebellopontine angle masses extending on to and expanding bilateral porous acusticus and internal entry canals consistent with bilateral vestibular schwannoma. 6-mm meningioma in the floor of the right middle cranial fossa stable. Stable asymmetric prominence of the left foramen rotundum and foramen ovale. Foci of T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in subcortical and deep white matter of the right greater than left frontal lobes stable with no evidence of enhancement. There has been interval increase in the size of focus of T2 signal abnormality and enhancement in the cervicomedullary junction (series 3 image 3 and series 10 image 3). Further characterization with MRI of the cervical spine with IV contrast is recommended as this may represent interval development of a glioma. No acute infarction intracranial hemorrhage midline shift or extra-axial collection. The ventricles and basal cisterns are patent. The orbits are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are essentially clear. Incompletely characterized mass with cystic and solid components in the right carotid sheath.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of bilateral vestibular schwannoma. Stable meningioma in the floor of the right middle cranial fossa. 2. Interval increase in size and interval enhancement at the cervicomedullary junction. Further characterization with MRI of the cervical spine with IV contrast is recommended as this can represent interval development of a glioma. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
