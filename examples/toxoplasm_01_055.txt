Diseases: ['toxoplasmosis']
FINDINGS:

Numerous areas of abnormal T2 and FLAIR signalabnormality is noted in the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally worse on the right side. Some regions are confluent while othersare more focal. The more confluent areas are seen in the rightbasal ganglia extending into the right corona radiata. The morefocal lesions are seen in the medial right occipital lobe leftbasal ganglia and bifrontal regions as well as the right insular left medial temporal right basal ganglia and right peri caudatelocations.These lesions do not demonstrate restricted diffusion. Postcontrast imaging demonstrates many of the focal lesions toenhance some in a ring-like fashion. The more confluent regionsof FLAIR signal abnormality do not demonstrate enhancement orsignificant mass effect on the adjacent ventricles or sulci. Noneof these lesions demonstrate hemorrhage.The enhancing lesion in the right basal ganglia abuts the thirdventricle The lesion in the left medial temporal lobe and theright lateral temporal lobe and right occipital lobe are in closeproximity to the dura.The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Numerous ring enhancing lesions as detailed above consistentwith the patient's history of toxoplasmosis. The lesions howeverremain age indeterminate.Also in the consideration is lymphoma.These two entities could be distinguished further with nuclearthallium imaging. Correlation with prior studies from Templehospital would be helpful.2. More confluent regions of signal abnormality in the rightcerebral hemisphere without significant mass effect or enhancementsuggests possible PML.
