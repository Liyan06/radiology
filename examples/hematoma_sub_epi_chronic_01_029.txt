Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Again noted is a left-sided craniotomy. Since the priorexamination there has been shrinkage of postoperative cavity inleft temporal lobe and marked interval improvement in surroundingFLAIR and T2 signal abnormality. There is residual signalabnormality involving both cortex and immediately-underlying whitematter. This does not result in any appreciable mass effect anddoes not enhance with gadolinium. There is focal enhancementunderlying the craniotomy site more prominent than on priorstudies which likely represents a small chronic subdural hematomawhich has appeared since the priot study. This does not cause anyappreciable mass effect. No other enhancing areas in the brain ormeninges are identified.Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent.No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect.Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posteriorcirculation as well as the superior sagittal sinus.Pituitary fossa posterior fossa and both orbits areunremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Marked decrease in size of left temporal lobe surgical cavityand improvement of surrounding signal abnormality in adjacentparenchyma. Residual signal abnormality is suggestive of residualnon-enhancing tumor2. Increased enhancement underlying craniotomy likelyrepresenting small chronic subdural hematoma which has appearedsince the prior study.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
