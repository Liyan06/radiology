Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is a intra axial mass in the right posterior frontal/parietal region. This mass measures 4.2 CM in diameter and 5.0 CM in CC dimension. The mass is hyperintense peripherally on T2/flair images with central hypoattenuation. The central portion has susceptibility effect consistent with blood product or mineralization. On T1 weighted images a mass is predominantly hypointense to gray matter. The mass has slightly restricted diffusion/ADC images. There is moderate surrounding T2/flair hyperintensity which may represent a combination of edema and infiltrative tumor. The hyperintense portions of the mass on T2 images demonstrate avid enhancement while the central portion does not enhance suggesting necrosis. There is enhancement of the dura overlying the mass see chrome image numbers 28-31 which is suspicious for leptomeningeal spread. There is mass effect on the atrium and occipital horns of the right lateral ventricle. The temporal horns appear symmetric. There is dilatation of the left lateral ventricular system. There is shift of midline from right to left of approximately 1 cm. There are several scattered punctate foci of T2/flair hyperintensity. Although nonspecific may reflect small vessel ischemic change. No evidence for acute infarction. Very mild scattered mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses. The mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Aggressive appearing necrotic 5 cm intra-axial right frontoparietal tumor. The mass involves the overlying gray matter and there is dural enhancement which is worrisome for leptomeningeal spread. 2. There is mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricular system mass effect at the level of the foramina of Monroe and third ventricle may be causing some degree of obstructive hydrocephalus. No evidence of transependymal egress of CSF at this time.
