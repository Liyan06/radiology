Diseases: ['meningioma', 'hematoma']
FINDINGS:

There has been interval right-sided orbitozygomatic craniotomy with debulking of the right sided sphenocavernous meningioma. The tumor is still encasing and significantly narrowing the right internal carotid artery. There is a convex contour of the right transverse cavernous sinus. The tumor extends to the superior orbital fissure. There is a subdural collection over the right frontal lobe with fluid-fluid level and blood products of different ages. It measures 13 mm in maximum thickness. There is a slight mass effect secondary to this epidural hematoma on the right frontal lobe with partial effacement of the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle. There is minimal midline shift towards the left as well. No evidence of transtentorial or uncal or subfalcine herniation. There is prominence of the subarachnoid space anterior to the right frontal lobe. There is enhancement and thickening of the adjacent dura consistent with postoperative changes. The soft tissues of the scalp demonstrate significant swelling and inflammatory changes consistent with postoperative changes. The retro-bulbar fat on both sides is clear. The superior ophthalmic veins are not distended. The paranasal sinuses are normal. Aside from postsurgical changes the skull is normal. No acute infarction.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post debulking of the right spheno-cavernous meningioma. The remaining tumor encases and significantly narrows the right internal carotid artery and extends to the superior orbital fissure. 2. Epidural hematoma over the right frontal lobe measuring maximum of 13 mm in thickness. It causes a slight midline shift. No evidence of herniation. Post surgical changes in the scalp.
