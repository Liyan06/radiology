Diseases: ['toxoplasmosis', 'toxoplasmosis']
FINDINGS:

Once again seen are multiple lesions involving the bilateral basal ganglia ranging in size from 1-2 cm consistent with given diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. There is no interval change in number of these lesions. No new lesions identified. Accounting for differences in study technique there is mild interval reduction in size of lesions most notably the lesion in the left globus pallidus. It measures 13 mm in maximum axial diameter on the postcontrast images (image 17 series 8) as compared to 20 mm on the prior study (image 17 series 8). Compared to the prior studies there continues to be interval reduction of surrounding edema. This reduction is mild compared to the 11/7/08 study and moderate compared to the 10/24/08 study. Although evaluation of contrast enhancement is difficult because these lesions demonstrate T1 shortening on the precontrast images the degree of enhancement appears essentially unchanged. As seen on prior studies there is susceptibility artifact on the gradient echo images consistent with the presence of blood products. There is associated mild Wallerian degeneration in the right midbrain unchanged. There is a partially empty sella. There is cerebral volume loss more than would be expected for patient this age likely due to underlying disease. There is no evidence of acute transcortical infarct
IMPRESSION:

1. Continued mild interval improvement in appearance of the bilateral lateral basal ganglia lesions consistent with toxoplasmosis. No new lesions identified. Addendum: There is an approximately 3 mm enhancing lesion in the subcortical white matter of the left occipital lobe seen on image 17 series 8 which is appeared since last exam consistent with toxoplasmosis. Several small enhancing lesions in the cerebellum have resolved since last.
