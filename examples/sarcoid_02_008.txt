Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

Within the brain the ventricles cisterns and sulci are within normal limits. There is no mass mass effect hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. No acute ischemia. No abnormal enhancement. Intracranial flow voids are maintained. A retention cyst/polyp is present in the right maxillary sinus. The mastoid air cells are underpneumatized. There is prominence of the nasopharyngeal soft tissues. Direct visualization is recommended. Evaluation of the cervical spine demonstrates normal appearance of the cervical vertebral bodies. Disc heights are maintained. No abnormal cord signal that can be confirmed on orthogonal images. There is no abnormal enhancement. Within the thoracic spine the vertebral body heights are maintained. There is a small disc bulge at T10-11 without canal stenosis. There is abnormal signal within the distal thoracic cord at the T11-12 level extending into the lumbar spine which is not imaged on today's study. The distal thoracic cord is expanded and there is patchy heterogeneous enhancement of the cord at this level. There is probable nerve root enhancement of T12 in the right seen only on the sagittal images as the axial images do not go through this region.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI of the brain: Unremarkable MRI of the brain. 2. MRI of the cervical spine: Unremarkable MRI of the cervical spine. 3. MRI of the thoracic spine: Heterogeneous T2 signal in the distal thoracic cord with patchy heterogeneous enhancement most consistent with but not specific for known diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Inflammatory and neoplastic etiologies can have a similar appearance. Attending comment: Agree with the above report. 20 mL of Omniscan were injected intravenously. The described enhancement is patchy predominantly along the surface of the cord and as stated compatible with a process such as sarcoid other etiologies as previously discussed are not excluded.
