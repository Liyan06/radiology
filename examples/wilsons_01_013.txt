Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The brain parenchyma is normal in signal intensity. There is milc cerebellar tonsillar ectopia. There are no areas of abnormal enhancement. GRE images show a focus of signal loss in or near the left Sylvian fissure. Other foci of signal loss in the left temporal lobe and right frontal lobe. Mild mucosal changes in maxillary sinuses. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. MRA of the circle of Willis shows no evidence of intracranial stenosis or occlusion. There is a small 2 mm focus of flow-related enhancement posterior to the M1 segment of the left MCA probable small aneurysm (series 10 image 85). There is a fenestration of the proximal basilar artery with the left and right AICAs coming off of the left and right branches of the fenestration. No aneurysm is seen in this location. MRA of the cervical vessels shows normal caliber and course of the carotid arteries from their origins to the intracranial portions. The right vertebral artery is dominant. The left vertebral artery is small throughout much of its course and gets larger more distally at around the C1 level. There are prominent muscular collaterals suggesting chronic disease.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute ischemia. 2. Scattered foci of signal loss in the brain probable small old hemorrhages. 3. Probable chronic stenosis/occlusion of non-dominant left vertebral artery with distal recanalization via muscular collaterals. 4. Small 2 mm aneurysm at the left M1 segment. 5. Incidental fenestration of basilar artery a vascular variant. 6. Incidental cerebellar tonsillar ectopia.
