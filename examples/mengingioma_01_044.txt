Diseases: ['meningioma', 'meningioma', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass demonstrating isointense T1 and hypointense T2 signal is seen in the region of the anterior falx unchanged from prior study. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Areas of increased FLAIR signal on the visualized within periventricular white matter appears to be decreased as compared to prior study. These are not associated mass effect. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted bilateral maxillary ethmoid sinuses. Patient is status post bilateral medial antrectomy.
IMPRESSION:

1. frontal meningioma adjacent to anterior falx is a change the2. Areas of increased FLAIR signal within the ventricular white matter decreased compared to prior study. This is a nonspecific finding and in the appropriate clinical setting (high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus) this can reflect small vessel ischemic disease. However other vascular and inflammatory processes are not excluded and clinical correlation is advised. Case was discussed Dr. Felsenstein on 4/27/06 at 10:45pm.ATTENDING: Agree with the above report. The meningioma is difficult to measure because of its somewhat lobulated appearance. It's probably about 2.5 cm in its longest dimension. There is no evidence for edema surrounding the meningioma. Patchy enhancement post contrast of the meningioma is observed.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
