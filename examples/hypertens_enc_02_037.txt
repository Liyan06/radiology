Diseases: ['rhombencephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Marked susceptibility effects related to metal at the left face. Focal signal in right cerebellum without mass effect or volume loss. Similar signal in left cerebellum to a lesser extent. Focal signal abnormalities in bilateral cerebral hemispheres nonspecific but probably chronic ischemic change. With contrast no abnormal enhancement. Focal marrow abnormalities in skull and skull base likely related to myeloma. Probable resection of left parietal bone at the vertex.
IMPRESSION:

1. Marked artifacts related to metal. 2. Focal signal in bilateral cerebellum right worse than left nonspecific. This may reflect ischemia but other etiologies are not excluded including rhombencephalitis toxic encephalopathy or hypertensive encephalopathy. Clinical correlation advised. CT may be helpful. 3. Other areas of signal in the bilateral hemispheres also nonspecific. Suspect chronic ischemic change; clinical correlation advised. Consider vascular evaluation. Review of EPIC at 4:43 PM on 12/21/12 reveals that Dr. Vogl is already aware of these abnormalities.
