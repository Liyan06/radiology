Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

There are postoperative changes from a right retromastoidoccipital craniotomy for resection of known right acousticneuroma including packing material and extraaxial blood in theregion of the cerebellopontine angle. There is mild mass effecton the right cerebellum. Increased T1 signal on pre and postgadolinium is may be postoperative and it is difficult todetermine the presence of residual mass. The subdural hemorrhagecan also be seen along the tentorium cerebelli and extending overthe occipital lobe.There is thrombosis of the right sigmoid and transverse duralsinuses. The left transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as thesagittal sinuses and deep venous system are patent. However thepatent sinuses and cortical veins are prominent suggestingincreased venouspressure. Intravascular enhancement overconvexities is also prominent and likely represent venouscongestion. No evidence of a parenchymal abnormality to suggestvenous ischemia.There is no midline shift. The basal cisterns are patent. Thereis no hydrocephalus. There is mild tonsillar ectopia.Mild paranasal sinus disease in the bilateral maxillary andsphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. Postoperative changes from retromastoid right occipitalcraniotomy for resection of right acoustic neuroma. Some of theextraaxial hemorrhage extends along the tentorium cerebelli andover the right occipital convexity.2. Thrombosis of the right transverse and sigmoid dural sinuses with prominence of the remainder of the dural sinuses and corticalveins suggesting increased venous pressure but no parenchymalabnormality reflecting venous ischemia at this time.Discussed with Dr. Baltuch at the time of attendinginterpretation.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
