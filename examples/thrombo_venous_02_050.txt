Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Lack of flow in the superior aspect of the superior sagittal sinusconsistent with thrombosis.Hypoplasia of the right transverse and sigmoid sinuses. The lefttransverse and sigmoid sinus are patent.Gradient-echo images shows susceptibility in the medial leftparietal lobe and along the cortex of what appears to the centralsulcus on the left side. T1-weighted images show high signal inthis area suggestive of laminar necrosis. Two foci of enhancementare also noted in this area after administration of gadolinium mayrepresent a subacute enhancing infarct. Advise follow up.Diffusion weighted images do not show restricted diffusion.T2-weighted images show edema in the left posterior frontal lobe.Few scattered and confluent foci of T2 hyperintensity are noted inthe periventricular subcortical and deep white matter nonspecific and in the appropriate clinical setting would beconsistent with sequela of small vessel ischemic disease.There is a polyp/mucous retention cyst in the sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. thrombosis on the superior sagittal sinus as describedabove.2. Subacute and old hemorrhagic venous infarct with associatedenhancement.3. Small vessel ischemic changes in the periventricular andsubcortical white matter.Findings discussed with Dr. Vidal a 10:20 PM on February 28 2005.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
