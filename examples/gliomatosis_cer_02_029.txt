Diseases: ['encephalitis', 'encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There is generalized T2/flair hyperintensity throughout the subcortical and deep white matter of the right frontal-parietal lobes with mass-effect causing sulcal effacement. However the right lateral ventricle appears larger in size than the left. No postcontrast enhancement is identified. No diffusion restriction. There is decreased cerebral blood volume in the areas of flair abnormality. Spectroscopy analysis shows some nonspecific mildly elevated choline to creatine. No significant decrease in NAA or elevated myoinositol identified. There is volume loss of the left cerebral hemisphere with prominent sulci more than expected for age. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal nonenhancing T2/flair signal with mass-effect throughout the white matter of the right frontal parietal lobes. The asymmetric involvement of the right cerebral hemisphere and lack of infiltration into the cortex or corpus callosum suggests an inflammatory/infectious encephalitis such as Rasmussen encephalitis. This would be a slightly atypical presentation for infiltrating tumor such as gliomatosis cerebri however this cannot be totally excluded. Further evaluation with MRA may be of help to exclude atypical presentation of vasculitis. In the absence of a history of seizures since childhood hemimegalencephaly is extremely unlikely. 2. Decreased volume of the left cerebral hemisphere more than expected for age of unclear etiology. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
