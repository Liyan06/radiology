Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

The patient is status post pterional craniotomy for olfactory groove meningioma resection which were located just above the mildly expanded with superiorly bowing left sphenoid sinus as demonstrated on outside study on series 9 image 19 and series 8 image 12. There is thin linear dural enhancement in the surgical bed most notable on series 9 image 13 which most likely reflect post surgical change and follow up for residual tumor as clinically warranted. Again seen is elevation of the left ventral skull base above the left sphenoid sinus about 8 mm higher than the contralateral side. Also the left optic canal appears circumferentially surrounded by signal void probably from extensive sphenoid sinus pneumatization extending into the anterior clinoid as seen on series 9 image 13. This appearance is similar to the outside preop examination as seen on series 9 image 18. Osseous dehiscence would be better evaluated with CT. There is a approximately 1.6 cm extra axial postoperative fluid collection overlying the left frontal lobe resulting in mild mass effect upon the adjacent parenchyma/frontal horn and 3-4 mm left to right midline shift. There is no acute infarct. Mild cytotoxic edema of the inferior left frontal lobe is noted. Extensive sinus signal void of the sphenoid sinuses also extend to pterygoid and sphenoid wings.
IMPRESSION:

1. Post surgical changes of left pterional craniotomy and resection of the olfactory groove meningioma without convincing residual tumor. 2. Asymmetric elevation of the left ventral skull base above the left sphenoid sinus from extensive pneumatization of the sphenoid sinuses and stable appearance of the pre-chiasmatic left optic nerve/optic canal. 3. Follow-up exam should be obtained with orbit protocol. Findings were communicated with and acknowledged by Dr. Peter Syre at 9AM on 1/14/2010.
