Diseases: ['epilepsy']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric but decreased global intracranial volume additional volume loss cerebellum with question partial agenesis inferior vermis. Temporal horns are symmetric in volume although the left hippocampus is slightly smaller in volume landmarks less well-visualized left hippocampus compared to right and slight increase in intensity better appreciated on FLAIR images (series 7) than T2-weighted images in coronal planes; however fornices appear relatively symmetric as do mammillary bodies. Internal landmarks right mesial temporal structures better defined than on left but not clearly defined on all images but no convincing volume loss or clear abnormal increased intensity on right. There is blurring of gray-white matter margin left anterior and inferior medial temporal lobe (series 6 and 7 images 17-20) and confirmed on axial T2-weighted and flair images (series 3 and 9). No defined mass or enhancing lesion is appreciated. No heterotopia. Mild inflammatory changes left maxillary and ethmoid air cells without fluid level. Orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse decreased intracranial volume and in addition suspect atrophy posterior fossa structures with partial agenesis inferior vermis. 2. Slight asymmetry hippocampus smaller volume on the left with increased intensity on long-TR images and suspect cortical dysplasia anterior inferomedial left temporal lobe. Correlate for left temporal lobe epilepsy. Note is however made of slight blurring of landmarks mesial temporal structures on the right without volume loss or convincing abnormal increased intensity cannot exclude bilateral abnormality.
