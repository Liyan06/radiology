Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple small foci of abnormal increased signal intensity on T2 weighted and flair images supratentorial greater than infratentorial and the localizing primarily to white matter. Some of these lesions are ovoid and oriented perpendicular to or at the ventricular margin and would be consistent with clinical history of multiple sclerosis. Foci of signal abnormality are also seen in the brainstem on the right as before. In addition there is an encephalomalacic focus left is basal ganglia with abnormal signal extending into internal capsule cerebral peduncle and further to medullary pyramid on the left with pattern suggestive of Wallerian degeneration. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. No abnormal enhancement. Focal 4-5mm flow void midline along course of right anterior cerebral artery is suggestive of pericallosal aneurysm stable compared to prior and verified on prior CT angiogram December 9 2011 appears relatively stable. In the cervical spine alignment is straightened which may be at least partially positional. Signal intensity of the bone marrow within normal limits. Abnormal signal intensity in the cervical cord redemonstrated at C2/3 dorsal and right similar to prior. Motion minimally degrades detail no other convincing focal lesions and no abnormal enhancement pattern overall similar to prior.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable supratentorial greater than infratentorial white matter hyperintensities features of pattern where consistent with clinical history of multiple sclerosis but no new lesions or abnormal enhancement. 2. Chronic infarct left basal ganglia with associated Wallerian degeneration 3. Stable cervical cord lesion dorsal and right C2/3 level stable no convincing new or enhancing lesions in the cervical cord. 4. Pericallosal aneurysm appears relatively stable compared to prior MRI and CT angiogram studies.
