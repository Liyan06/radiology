Diseases: ['myelinolysis']
FINDINGS:

The diffusion weighted images are technically limited however there is apparent diffusion restriction involving the cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere particularly in the parasagittal frontoparietal lobe occipital lobe subinsular region hippocampus mesial temporal lobe and right thalamus. There is associated flair signal abnormality in these regions. Findings are compatible with recent seizure activity. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Prominence of ventricles slightly out of proportion to sulci is stable. There is confluent patchy signal abnormality in the periventricular white matter which is nonspecific however likely represents sequela of chronic microvascular change. Signal abnormality in the pons is nonspecific and may represents sequela of small vessel ischemia. Differential diagnosis includes central Pontine myelinolysis. Patient is intubated. There are secretions in the sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Apparent diffusion restriction and flair signal abnormality involving the cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere as described above as well as the left thalamus and hippocampus. Findings are compatible with recent seizure activity. 2. Signal abnormality in the pons is nonspecific and may represent sequela small vessel ischemic disease. Differential diagnosis includes central pontine myelinolysis but this is less likely. Above discussed with Dr. Narawanaswamy at 11 p.m.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
