Diseases: ['craniopharyngioma']
FINDINGS:

The pituitary gland is minimally enlarged. There is a minimally heterogeneous T2-bright focus with T2-dark nodule superior and left within it. There appears to be a dark fluid-fluid and possibly hematocrit level layering posteriorly (series 5 image 11) not clearly evident on T1-weighted images however. There is relative lack of enhancement in the T2-bright part of the pituitary lesion but there is enhancement in the superior aspect of the lesion (series 9 image 18 and series 10 image 10). The diameter of the pituitary lesion is about 7-8 mm and it is positioned midline and just left of midline within the gland. There is minimal elevation of left greater than right pre-chiasmatic optic nerves. The ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and minimally prominent within normal limits for stated age of 76. There are scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter mild in extent and nonspecific possibly chronic small vessel ischemic changes though not specific for this. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified.
IMPRESSION:

1. 7-8 mm T2-bright and possibly partially cystic defined focus in minimally expanded pituitary gland left central gland possible tiny hematocrit level layering posteriorly and enhancing focus superior aspect of the more cystic portion of the lesion minimal elevation left greater than right prechiasmatic optic nerves correlate for vision dysfunction. Microadenoma is possible although the appearance is not typical for this correlate for hormonal abnormalities. Metastatic focus is possible correlate for known primary but no other suspicious foci are identified in in the bony structures or brain. Lesion appears to be centered within the gland doubt craniopharyngioma. Comparison with any outside imaging studies would be helpful if available. 2. Nonspecific white matter hyperintensities in the brain possibly chronic small vessel ischemic changes but not specific for this.
