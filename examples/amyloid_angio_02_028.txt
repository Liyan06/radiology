Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

Ventricles and CSF spaces are symmetric and minimally prominent for age. Scattered T2 bright foci are identified in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter moderate extent and some nearly confluent periatrial regions. Deep gray matter are relatively spared anterior white matter and infratentorial spared. No acute findings on diffusion-weighted images. Multiple foci of abnormal susceptibility are seen peripheral distribution and mostly in the left greater than right parieto-occipital regions to a lesser degree left superior temporal and inferior or posterior frontal locations There are no other abnormal foci of increased or decreased signal intensity. Mesial temporal lobe volume is mild though asymmetric left more than right although this could be exaggerated by anatomic variation with entire left lateral ventricle although larger than right and morphology on the left is a little rounded. The fornices and mamillary bodies are symmetric.
IMPRESSION:

1. Relatively mild parenchymal volume loss for age left lateral ventricle including temporal horn larger than right which may exaggerate asymmetric appearance of mesial temporal lobes question mild volume loss left mesial temporal lobe structures compared to right however. 2. Multiple foci of abnormal susceptibility peripherally worst in the parieto-occipital regions left more than right. Central brain relatively spared pattern suggestive of amyloid angiopathy. 3. Patchy hyperintensities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images periventricular deep and subcortical white matter which are nonspecific with moderate in extent possibly vascular etiology but differential is broad and pattern nonspecific.
