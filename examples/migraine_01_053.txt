FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated are a few subcortical and deep white matter foci of increased FLAIR signal in the frontal lobes. Otherwise the brain parenchyma is unremarkable. There are no areas restricted diffusion. There is no susceptibility artifact. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size for the patient's stated age. No extraaxial collection.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Redemonstrated nonspecific small foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the frontal lobe white matter. This can be seen in the setting of migraine headaches among other etiologies.
