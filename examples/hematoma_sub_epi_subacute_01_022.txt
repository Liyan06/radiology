Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Since prior examination patient has developed large extraaxialfluid collection in the left cerebral hemisphere extending fromthe frontal to the occipital lobe. It is bright on the T1-weightedimages and heterogeneous on the T2-weighted images and isconsistent with subacute subdural hematoma. There is a thin rim ofdural enhancement around this extraaxial fluid collection. Thereis a mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma and midbrain witheffacement of sulci and partial compression on the left lateralventricle. There is approximately 8 mm midline shift. Thebasilar cisterns are patent.Again noted is a arachnoid cyst at superior left frontalconvexity unchanged since prior examination.There are several small nonspecific foci of increased signal onthe long-TR weighted sequences which possibly represent smallvessel ischemic disease. No areas of slowed diffusion are seen.There are appropriate flow voids in the visualized cerebralvessels.Besides mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus craniofacial structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Large subacute subdural hematoma in the left cerebralhemisphere with mass effect and midline shift as described above.2. Stable arachnoid cyst at the left frontal convexity.3. Nonspecific foci of abnormal signal in the periventricular andsubcortical white matter probably small vessel ischemic disease.4. Findings were immediately communicated to Dr. Cirigliano patient's primary-care physician on May 6 2003 at 23:50 PM.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
