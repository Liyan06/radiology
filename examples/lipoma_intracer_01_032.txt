Diseases: ['lipoma']
FINDINGS:

No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarct. Mild subcortical and periventricular white matter flair hyperintensities a nonspecific finding but in this patient's age group commonly associated with chronic small vessel ischemic change. Minimal global volume loss. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as the superior sagittal sinus. T1 and T2 hyperintense soft tissue mass adjacent to the left parietal calvarium imaging features are consistent with a lipoma clinical correlation recommended.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute intracranial process no acute ischemia. 2. Minimal global volume loss and probable sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic change. 3. Left parietal lipoma. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST ADDITION: I agree with the preliminary report with the following additions: Small proximally 7 mm T2-intermediate nodular density along anterior aspect masseter muscle (seies 6 and 7 images 5 6) uncertain origin possibly small lymph node and relatively benign appearance but incompletely characterized. Correlate with exam. Ultimately nonemergent imaging with enhanced CT or MRI orbits could be arranged as outpatient as clinically indicated.
