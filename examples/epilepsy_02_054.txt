Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

There is encephalomalacia right posterior inferior temporal lobe with blooming on susceptibility-weighted images consistent with blood products and/or mineralization. There is minimal ex vacuo dilatation occipital horn suspect that this does not communicate with the ventricle ependymal margin felt to be visualized on coronal T2-weighted images (series 6). Right temporal horn is minimally prominent compared to the left but this may be related to ex vacuo dilatation as opposed to mesial temporal volume loss. There is no asymmetry in signal intensity although anterior hippocampus may show slight volume loss compared to left (series 6 images 21 and 22). There are additional hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter nonspecific. There is another focus of decreased intensity on susceptibility weighted images left frontal subcortical white matter which may represents small old micro bleed. There is one possible focus of cortical enhancement (series 17 image 35) along superior frontal gyrus on left seen also on 3-D sagittal T1 weighted but appears more vascular on the latter sequence (series 18 image 65).
IMPRESSION:

1. Encephalomalacia with probable blood products right inferior temporal occipital region suspect old infarct or bleed. There may be slight volume loss and anterior right hippocampus but suspect asymmetry in temporal horns more related to ex vacuo dilatation. No acute ischemia. Correlate for side of seizures. 2. Nonspecific white matter hyperintensities one tiny micro bleed left frontal white matter. 3. Possible tiny enhancing cortical focus left superior frontal gyrus but suspect this may be vascular. Consider short-term follow-up in approximtely four weeks to assess stability. Discussed findings with Dr. Jenssen 4/7/2009.
