Diseases: ['lipoma']
FINDINGS:

Much better seen on the current study there is a defined T1-bright structure associated with right greater than left mamillary body and just inferior better characterized on the current study and Likely lipoma. Fat-saturated sequences show loss of the T1-bright signal and does not enhance. It measures about 8 mm AP and about 3 mm maximal superior inferior. On gradient-echo images there is some susceptibility which was seen also previously likely some mineral associated. No comparison CT. The ventricles and CSF spaces are otherwise symmetric and appropriate for age. On gradient-echo images redemonstrated is a blush of susceptibility right centrum semiovale (series 4 image 25). On postcontrast images this shows enhancement and is most consistent with a capillary telangiectasia better seen on the fat saturated postcontrast images. There are no other abnormal foci of increased or decreased signal intensity and no abnormal parenchymal enhancement elsewhere in the brain. Skull orbits and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. Attention to the sella shows otherwise normal appearance stalk is midline size within normal limits and no differential enhancement within the gland.
IMPRESSION:

1. Small lipoma associated with mammillary bodies just inferior and right greater than left minimal susceptibility likely indicating some mineral associated better characterized on the current study as compared to prior. 2. Small capillary telangiectasia right centrum semiovale better evaluated on the current study. Unremarkable MRI brain otherwise.
