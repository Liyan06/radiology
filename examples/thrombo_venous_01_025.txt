Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Postsurgical changes are noted related to interval resection of the previously noted right cerebellopontine angle mass with retrosigmoid craniectomy cranioplasty. CSF fills the surgical site. There is mild enhancement interdigitating in the right cerebellar hemisphere at the site of resection likely surgically related or superimposed developmental venous anomaly. There is gross total resection of the enhancing neoplasm and minimal linear enhancement around the surgical bed can be followed for residua. There is also restricted diffusion within the medial right cerebellum and middle cerebellar peduncle and minimally in the right upper medulla adjacent to the site of surgical resection see series 6 image 9. The dominant right-sided sigmoid-transverse sinus show normal signal without evidence of thrombosis. There is stable right greater than left cerebellar tonsillar ectopia crowding of the posterior fossa and mass effect on the right side of brainstem and cerebellum.
IMPRESSION:

1. Appropriate surgical change of right retrosigmoid craniectomy-cranioplasty for surgical resection of the right cerebellopontine mass lesion. 2. Gross total resection of path-pending vesticular schwannoma. 3. Small cytotoxic edema of right CPA and minimally in the upper medulla surgical bed. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation and agree with the findings in this report.
