Diseases: ['encephalomalacia', 'gliosis']
FINDINGS:

Study is degraded by motion artifact. Stable right temporal craniotomy. Stable anterior/mid right temporal lobe encephalomalacia with mild stable surrounding parenchymal gliosis. Stable ex vacuo dilatation of the right temporal horn. Several small foci of periventricular cerebral white matter FLAIR signal abnormality are mildly more conspicuous and remain nonspecific in nature. Differential includes chronic small vessel ischemic disease demyelinating process inflammatory/infectious cause and vasculopathy among others. No interval acute intracranial hemorrhage new extra-axial fluid collection or evidence for acute parenchymal ischemia. No mass-effect or midline shift. Basal cisterns are patent. No abnormal intracranial enhancement seen. Mild mucosal thickening within right maxillary sinus right greater than left ethmoid air cells and right frontal sinus. Bilateral concha bullosa. Mild fluid within the right mastoid air cells unchanged. Left mastoids clear. There is mild increase in the prominence of the adenoid lymphoid tissue. Clinically correlate.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable right temporal craniotomy. Stable right temporal lobe encephalomalacia with stable mild surrounding gliosis and right temporal horn ex vacuo dilatation. 2. Small foci of cerebral white matter signal abnormality mildly more conspicuous and remain nonspecific. Differential include chronic small vessel ischemic disease demyelination inflammatory/infectious causes and vasculopathy among others. 3. Mild increase in prominence of adenoid/ nasopharyngeal soft tissue for which direct inspection is recommended. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
