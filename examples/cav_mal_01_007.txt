Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles are normal in size and position. Thereis no mass effect midline shift or edema. There is no intra orextra-axial fluid collections. There is no intraparenchymalhemorrhage. There is slight irregularity of the upper surface ofthe atrium of the right lateral ventricle with a 3 mm T2hypointense area in the adjacent white matter which does notenhance. This is best appreciated on series 6 image No. 8. Onflair images there are scattered areas of hyperintensity withinthe cortical sulci.The patient is status post sinonasal surgery including bilateralethmoidectomies and uncinectomies. There is near totalopacification of the right maxillary sinus.Diffusion weighted imaging demonstrates no acute ischemia.Gradient echo imaging shows no hemosiderin deposItion within thebrain.A tiny venous angioma seen in the right frontal lobe on series 12 image No. 6. Enhanced images are otherwise unremarkable.Intracranial portions of both internal carotid arteries and majorbranches are unremarkable.Basilar artery and major branches are unremarkable.Intracranial portions of both vertebral arteries are unremarkable.However the intradural portion of the left vertebral artery ishypoplastic.
IMPRESSION:

1. Signal abnormality in the subependymal region adjacent to theatrium of the right lateral ventricle which may represent an areaof heterotopia; thin sections in the axial and coronal plane withT1 and T2 weighting can be obtained for more definitive evaluationif clinically indicated.2. Slight hyperintensity within the cortical sulci on flairimaging without associated pathologic enhancement. This raisesthe possibility of subarachnoid spaced disease and correlationwith CSF sampling is advised.3. Paranasal sinus disease s/p sinonasal surgery as described.4. Normal MRA of the circle of Willis. Please note thatsensitivity is limited for aneurysms less than 3 mm in size.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
