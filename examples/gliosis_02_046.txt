Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Dental artifact limits some detail right face and skull base to lesser extent left face. Prior right frontal craniotomy associated encephalomalacia right frontal operculum in proximity with cystic changes as well as surrounding T2-bright signal suggestive of gliosis mild ex vacuo dilatation frontal horn right lateral ventricle. The ventricles and CSF spaces are otherwise symmetric and appropriate for age. There are occasional tiny T2-bright foci in the white matter relatively mild in number and not excessive for age. Attention to temporal lobes shows preservation of internal landmarks hippocampus no asymmetry in volume or signal intensity appreciated. Mamillary bodies are asymmetric right smaller than left suspect right fornix slightly smaller than left. No convincing heterotopia cortical dysplasia or encephalocele. No abnormal enhancement parenchyma although there is minimal dural enhancement at the site of craniotomy likely reactive. On axial images series 3 and 9 there is a question of hyperintensity anterior medial temporal cortex on T2 weighted and flair images but on coronal images this is not appreciated and felt to be artifactual related to metallic artifact.
IMPRESSION:

1. Previous right frontal craniotomy with associated postsurgical changes and also underlying encephalomalacia uncertain as to what original lesion or injury was or surgical results. 2. Medial temporal lobe structures nearly symmetric but right mamillary body smaller than left and suspect right fornix minimally decreased in caliber compared to the left as well correlate for seizures lateralizing to the right hemisphere with these and above findings.
