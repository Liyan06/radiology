Diseases: ['meningioma', 'meningitis']
FINDINGS:

The patient is intubated. As demonstrated on prior CT there are a sequela of prior right basal ganglia and internal capsule hemorrhage or infarct with ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle. The right cerebral peduncle is smaller than the left likely due to Wallerian degeneration. The ventricles and sulci are prominent in keeping with cerebral volume loss. There is a suprasellar mass measuring 8 x 11 mm most likely a meningioma from tuberulum sella/chiasmatic groove. There are multiple scattered areas of T2 weighted and FLAIR hyperintense signal involving the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter nonspecific but likely representing age related small vessel ischemic disease. There are no areas of restricted diffusion. There is abnormal FLAIR signal throughout the sulci likely related to high inspired O2 in this intubated patient. Other etiologies such as meningitis subarachnoid hemorrhage and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can also have this appearance. There is mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses with air-fluid levels in the bilateral maxillary sinuses possibly related to intubation. Fluid is also seen in the bilateral mastoid air cells. The orbits are grossly normal. There is a hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues posterior to the right ear.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute infarct no acute hemorrhage no edema. 2. Incidental suprasellar mass likely arising from the tuberculum sella probably meningioma. Visual testing is suggested given proximity to optic nerves. Enhanced MRI suggested for further characterization. 3. Sequela of prior hemorrhage or infarct in the right basal ganglia and internal capsule. 4. Increased FLAIR signal throughout the sulci likely related to high inspired O2 in this intubated patient. Other etiologies such as meningitis subarachnoid hemorrhage and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can also have this appearance so clinical correlation is advised.
