Diseases: ['lymphoma', 'toxoplasmosis']
FINDINGS:

There is extensive abnormal subependymal enhancement along bothlateral ventricles. There is abnormal T2 hyperintensity withinthe adjacent periventricular white matter as well as within themidbrain and pons. Signal abnormality extends into the septumpellucidum. 4 mm focus of enhancement is identified in the rightbasal ganglia with surrounding edema. There has been intervaldevelopment of mild ventricular dilatation consistent withhydrocephalus.On FLAIR images there is also hyperintensity within the corticalsulci in keeping with subarachnoid space disease.There is hypoattenuation of the marrow of the clivus andvisualized upper cervical spine in keeping with history of AIDS.Mildly prominent adenoidal tissue is also present.
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive abnormal subependymal enhancement with surroundinghyperintensity in the periventricular white matter septumpellucidum and brainstem with mild signal abnormality in thecortical sulci. There is also focus of abnormal enhancement inthe right basal ganglia (either parenchymal or perivascular).Findings are very likely related to either an infectious orneoplastic etiology. Both lymphoma and CMV have a predilectionfor subependymal spread and thus are the major differentialconsiderations. Other infectious etiologies such as Cryptococcus TB and toxoplasmosis are also possibilities.2.
