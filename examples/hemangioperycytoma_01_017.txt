Diseases: ['meningioma', 'hemangiopericytoma']
FINDINGS:

No definite interval surgical changes appreciated. Again noted is an enhancing extra-axial mass over the left occipital-parietal convexity with extension into the superior sagittal sinus and slightly across the midline. This is similar in size compared to most recent study. As noted on prior there is probably invasion of the superior sagittal sinus although a small narrowed flow void suggest some patency. In addition the overlying left parietal bone shows abnormal marrow signal and enhancement corresponding to areas of lytic lesions on head CT dated 1/29/2009. The previously noted right anterior parietal calvarium lesion at the vertex is partially obscured by motion. There is stable underlying edema within the left occipital lobe. There is also possibly a 3 mm enhancing lesion with in the lateral aspect of the right cerebellum without definite associated edema. This may represent an additional metastatic focus and close attention on follow up imaging to this region is recommended. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial fluid collection or midline shift. There is a right maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst.
IMPRESSION:

1. Motion degraded study. 2. Overall stable enhancing extra-axial mass over the left occipital-parietal convexity with probable invasion of the superior sagittal sinus although this could remain partially patent. Associated overlying bony calvarial changes. Metastatic disease is again favored. Less likely meningioma hemangiopericytoma. 3. Additional right anterior parietal calvarial lesion not well seen on current study due to motion. 4. Possible additional enhancing focus (3 mm) in right cerebellum. This may represent an additional metastatic focus and close attention on follow up imaging to this region is recommended.
