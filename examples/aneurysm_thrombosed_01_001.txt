Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and appear appropriate for age. There are multiple hyperintensities on T2 weighted and flair images localizing primarily to subcortical white matter especially frontal lobes but also parietal lobes atypical for age. No convincing cortical involvement. No acute findings on diffusion-weighted images. No abnormal enhancement. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are noted. MR angiogram of the head shows patent proximal intracranial internal branches. No evidence of aneurysm occlusion or high-grade stenosis. MR venogram of the head shows no T1-bright or expansile thrombus. Deep and superficial venous structures are in general patent though transverse sinuses appear small in caliber bilaterally and slightly irregular on right in comparison to other venous structures some of which may reflect anatomic variation but decreased caliber related to prior thrombosis with recanalization may cause this appearance. No comparisons.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple T2-bright foci of frontal greater than parietal subcortical white matter nonspecific pattern but atypical for age. Differential diagnosis is broad and includes primarily vascular and inflammatory etiologies correlate clinically consider follow-up in approximately 6 months depending on clinical findings and/or prior outside imaging if available. 2. Unremarkable MR angiogram of the head. 3. MR venogram shows decreased caliber right greater than left transverse sinus possible slight irregularity right more than left this may represent anatomic variation but would also be consistent with prior thrombosis with recanalization comparison with any prior outside imaging is needed.
