Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

There is no hydrocephalus or mass effect. No flow void isseen in basilar artery on T1 or T2 images. There is restricteddiffusion in the left cerebellum right medial occipital lobe and toa lesser degree diffusely throughout the pons and midbrain.MRA of the circle of Willis shows no evidence of intracranialstenosis occlusion or aneurysm in the anterior circulation.Diminished flow related enhancement is present within the intraduralleft vertebral artery. No flow related enhancement is seen within thebasilar artery from the vertebrobasilar junction to the basilar tip right posterior cerebral artery and left P1 segment of posteriorcerebral artery. There is filling of the remainder of the leftposterior cerebral artery by a left PCOM.
IMPRESSION:

1. Basilar thrombosis. Drs. Kasner and Weigel are aware of thisfinding and the patient had already been transferred to theneuroangiography suite.2. Acute infarcts in the left cerebellum right medial occipitallobe and probable acute ischemia throughout pons and midbrain. Thelesions in pons and midbrain however show less striking diffusionabnormalities compared to other peripheral posterior circulationinfarcts. Correlate with clinical exam.Addendum:Please note that this study consists essentially of MRA brainonly with the addition of diffusion-weighted images to thatstudy. A complete standard MRI of the brain was not performeddue to need for immediate intervention in this case.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: WOLF RONALD L MDAddended by: Interface TalkStation
