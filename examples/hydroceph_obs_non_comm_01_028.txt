Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

The image quality is degraded by motion and the use of faster imaging sequences which are used for this reason. There are several heterogeneously intra-axial enhancing masses within both cerebral hemispheres and within the cerebellum. Specifically these involve the right frontal lobe right parietal lobe left basal ganglia right occipital lobe vermis and right cerebellum. The largest is in the cerebellar vermis region measuring 3.6 cm in size. This causes effacement of the fourth ventricle. The lateral ventricles and third ventricle are enlarged. There is extensive T2 prolongation within the bilateral cerebral hemispheric white matter and within the cerebellum much of which is likely vasogenic edema from the intracranial masses. However there is likely a component of chronic ischemic white matter changes. Also correlate with any prior history of radiation treatment. There is also T2 prolongation surrounding the left basal ganglia lesion and chronic ischemic changes in the brainstem. There are several small punctate foci of restricted diffusion in the frontal-parietal lobes bilaterally (greater on the right) likely related to embolic infarctions. There is no extra-axial fluid collection or midline shift. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. There is partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple enhancing intra-axial masses consistent with metastatic disease. There is probably early obstructive hydrocephalus due to a large cerebellar vermis mass causing effacement of the fourth ventricle. 2. Small infarctions in the bilateral frontal-parietal lobes likely embolic in nature. These may be from a cardiac source. Dr. Siddiqi was notified of these findings by phone at 11 pm on 4/17/2008. Attending interpretation: Agree with above.
