Diseases: ['meningioma', 'hemangiopericytoma', 'metastasis']
FINDINGS:

There is a 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.5 cm parafalcine dural based enhancing T2 iso-to slightly hypointense mass adjacent to the medial aspect of left frontal lobe with mild adjacent edema and mass effect. There is no frank restricted diffusion associated with this mass. There is mild linear enhancement just superior to cerebellopontine angle on the right (see images 10 and 11 series 8) favored to be vascular given its similar appearance on prior neck MRI. There are no extra-axial fluid collections. There are multiple punctate foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the subcortical and deep white matter with prominent periventricular T2 hyperintensity which is nonspecific however probably reflects sequela of microvascular ischemic changes. There is no restricted diffusion. No suspicious foci of susceptibility. There is moderate generalized parenchymal volume loss without disproportionate ventriculomegaly. There are similar postsurgical changes are redemonstrated from prior right maxillectomy and hard palate resection; this exam is not tailored to assess for local recurrence. Prominent left maxillary mucous retention cysts. Frontal ethmoidal mucosal changes. T1 hyperintense appearance the imaged marrow probably reflective of radiation changes. There is nonspecific right much greater than left mastoid fluid
IMPRESSION:

1. 1.8-cm left frontal parafalcine dural based mass with local adjacent edema and mass effect. Differential considerations would include meningioma versus less likely hemangiopericytoma. In the setting of known squamous cell carcinoma and adjacent edema dural based metastasis is not entirely excluded. 2. Postsurgical changes from prior right maxillectomy and hard palate resection. This exam is not tailored to assess for recurrence.
