These findings were also present on the priorstudy.There is some FLAIR hyperintensity in a left cerebral sulcus.There is no midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume isappropriate for the patient's stated age. Following contrastadministration there is no pathologic enhancement.The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Thrombosis of the venous sinuses as above. This finding hasnot significantly changed since the last exam.2. Hyperintensity in the subarachnoid spaces as above worrisomefor subarachnoid hemorrhage.
