Diseases: ['migraine']
FINDINGS:

Evaluation of the brain shows multiple foci of T2 hyperintensityin the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally.Questionable focus of T2 hyperintensity is evident pons thoughthis may be related to pulsation artifact. One in the rightfrontal white matter is noted to have a somewhat ovoid appearance.There is no pathologic enhancement. There no areas of abnormallydecreased diffusion. Cerebral ventricles cortical sulci andbasilar cisterns are unremarkable.Cervical spine:There is a 1.5 cm mass in the left lobe of the thyroid gland.Vertebral body alignment is normal. The cervical cord is normalin signal intensity without pathologic enhancement. Mildposterior disc bulges at C3-4 C4-5 and C5-6 partially efface theventral subarachnoid space without cord compression.Thoracic spine:Images are moderately degraded by motion artifact. No area ofcord signal abnormality is identified. Spinal canal appearspatent. There is no pathologic enhancement.
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered foci of white matter signal abnormality in thebrain. This is a nonspecific finding. Differentialconsiderations include demyelinating disease Lyme disease vasculopathy small vessel ischemic disease migraine headaches.2. 1.5cm mass left lobe of the thyroid gland. Note that neoplasmcannot be excluded. Further evaluation with ultrasound isrecommended.3. No evidence of cervical or thoracic cord lesion. Milddegenerative changes in the cervical spine.Findings discussed with Dr. Scobie at 1:50 PM on 3-21-04.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStation
