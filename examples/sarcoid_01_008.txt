Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

Again noted is diffuse sinonasal opacification in the frontal sinuses ethmoid air cells sphenoid sinus and maxillary sinuses. Opacification is also present in the right mastoid air cells extending into the pneumatized petrous petrous bone. There appears to have been prior sinonasal surgery. Some of the secretions are hyperintense on T1-weighted sequence. The mucosal thickening demonstrates enhancement. The cavernous sinus enhances homogeneously and symmetrically. The superior ophthalmic veins are normal in caliber. Visualized portions of the internal carotid arteries are also within normal limits. There is diffuse subcutaneous edema in the frontal scalp and periorbital tissues which is nonspecific. In addition the lacrimal glands are enlarged which raises the possibility of connective tissue disorder or sarcoid. There is no retrobulbar mass or inflammatory fat stranding. On the postcontrast axial images there is a focus of linear enhancement in the region of the previously described defect of the posterior frontal sinus wall. There is no dural enhancement or evidence of intracranial abscess. There are bilateral intraparotid lymph nodes.
IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse sinonasal opacification without appreciable change from the most recent CT examination. 2. Patency of the cavernous sinuses and no evidence of intracranial extension. 3. Enlarged lacrimal glands which raises the suspicion of connective tissue disorder or sarcoidosis. 4. Diffuse edema frontal scalp and periorbital subcutaneous soft tissues nonspecific but differential includes both infectious and inflammatory etiologies.
