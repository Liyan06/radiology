Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

No mass effect midline shift or hydrocephalus. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or extracerebral fluid collection. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Prominent flow void in the basilar tip region compatible with aneurysm measuring 8-9 mm in diameter. A 1.4 x 3.3 cm fluid collection noted in the right cerebellopontine angle following fluid signal on all sequences and exerting mild mass effect on the right pons and cerebellum compatible with arachnoid cyst. No diffusion abnormalities. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. Minor mucosal changes noted in the paranasal sinuses. Mastoid air cells are clear. Orbits unremarkable. There is mild asymmetric appearance and thickening in the posterior aspect of the right occipital condyle/occipital bone without definite associated signal abnormality.
IMPRESSION:

1. No parenchymal brain abnormality. Specifically no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. 2. 8-9 mm basilar tip aneurysm. Recommend further evaluation with CTA or MRA. 3. Arachnoid cyst in the right cerebellopontine angle with mild mass effect on the right pons and cerebellum. 4. Mild asymmetric protuberance in the region of the right posterior occipital condyle/occipital bone. Recent PET scan demonstrated hypermetabolic activity in the right occipital region while a more recent bone scan did not demonstrate focal activity in this area. The findings are likely related to normal variation. However given abnormality on the PET scan CT of the neck may be helpful to evaluate for an underlying abnormality. Findings were discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Matro on 2/20/2009 at approximately 12:45 a.m. Attending review: Agree with above
