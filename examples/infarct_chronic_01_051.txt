Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

There is a partially visualized large right palatine tonsil mass as well as bulky necrotic right cervical lymphadenopathy better evaluated on recent PET-CT dated 5/11/2009. There are enlarged left cervical lymph nodes as well partially seen. Filling defects with associated T1 shortening and hyperintense FLAIR signal is consistent with thrombosis of the right transverse and sigmoid sinus as well as jugular bulb. In addition the right upper internal jugular vein is not well visualized and likely occluded or significantly compressed by bulky right cervical lymphadenopathy. No evidence of restricted diffusion or acute intracranial hemorrhage to suggest venous infarction. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear with exception of mild right maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION:

1. No focal parenchymal brain abnormality. 2. Thrombosis of the right transverse and sigmoid dural venous sinuses extending into the right jugular bulb probably nonocclusive. In addition the right upper internal jugular vein is not well visualized and likely occluded or significantly compressed by bulky right cervical lymphadenopathy. Right palatine tonsil mass and cervical lymphadenopathy. Correlate with dedicated neck imaging. Results sent to CRNP Faith Mutale by password protected email at 11:15 am on 5/30/2009.
