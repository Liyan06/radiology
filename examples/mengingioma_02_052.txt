Diseases: ['meningioma', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

BRAIN: There are mild malacic changes and T2 prolongation in the left parietal lobe consistent with history of prior hematoma in this area. Redemonstrated is a dural based mass along the right convexity of the temporal lobe measuring approximately 10 x 14 x 14 mm slightly enlarged from the prior study where it measured 10 x 10 x 11 mm. No significant underlying vasogenic edema mass-effect or shift of midline structures. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Stable old lacunar infarct in the right cerebellum. No interval acute infarction acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage or shift of midline structures. No hydrocephalus or effacement of basal cisterns. No extra-axial fluid collection is present. Visualized paranasal sinuses and bilateral mastoids appear unremarkable. MRA COW: There is redemonstration of a 6-mm left para-clinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm. This is relatively stable from the prior study in 2001 (allowing for some difference in technique). There is otherwise patency of the intracranial circulation including the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm. Posteriorly the bilateral intradural vertebral arteries basilar artery and distal branches are patent and free of hemodynamically significant stenosis.
IMPRESSION:

1. Slight interval increase in size of a right middle cranial fossa meningioma. 2. Relatively stable appearance to left para-clinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm 6 mm in diameter. 3. No interval acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage or acute infarction. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
