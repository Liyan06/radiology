Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

There are extensive areas of signal abnormality in the rightfrontal lobe predominantly as well as to a lesser extent in theanterior right parietal lobe and right caudate head. These areasshow extensive hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging there areareas of T1 hyperintensity predominantly involving cortex aswell as restricted diffusion. There is little or no associatedmass effect. The findings are consistent with areas of infarctionin the right anterior and right middle cerebral artery territorywhich appears predominantly subacute though may be acute areas.There is pathologic enhancement in these areas also consistentwith subacute infarction.Cerebral ventricles are nondilated and nondisplaced. There ismild hyperintensity along the right corticospinal tracts probablyearly Wallerian degeneration.MRA of the circle of Willis shows markedly attenuated flow signalpetrous cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the rightinternal carotid artery. No flow signal is demonstrated to in theproximal right middle cerebral artery in keeping with eitherocclusion or very slow flow. A1 segment of the right anteriorcerebral artery is hypoplastic. Remainder of the intracranialcirculation appears patent.1 cm Thornwaldt's cyst is noted.There is mild hypointensity of the calvarial marrow which isnonspecific but may be seen in association with chronic diseaseand anemia.
IMPRESSION:

1. Large areas of subacute infarction in the right frontal lobesinvolving portions of the right anterior cerebral artery and rightmiddle cerebral artery territory.2. Markedly attenuated flow signal of the visualized intracranialright internal carotid arteries and is right's middle cerebralartery with areas of occlusion vs. very slow flow. Furtherevaluation with MRA of the neck could be performed to assess for aproximal obstructing lesion.Findings discussed with Dr. Rahi at 11:45 am on 3-21-04Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
