Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

Encephalomalacic foci are identified right frontal and left occipital lobe which show susceptibility associated consistent with old hemorrhagic events and evolving since previous study with decreasing fluid level at the right frontal site. Minimal meningeal enhancement along the medial right frontal lobe in proximity is best appreciated on postcontrast FLAIR images different technique compared to prior and not necessarily new or unexpected. There is ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal horn right lateral ventricle. The ventricles and CSF spaces otherwise are symmetric but moderately prominent and more than expected for stated age of 85. There are numerous T2 bright foci in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter with lesser involvement deep gray matter structures moderate to marked in extent and nearly confluence but nonspecific pattern and similar to prior. On gradient-echo images there are multiple additional foci of susceptibility which are mostly peripheral and worst in the frontal lobes but also evident in temporal occipital regions. Comparing to prior the distribution is similar as is the extent deep structures relatively spared in this regard. Postcontrast imaging shows no suspicious focal enhancement. Bony structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving hemorrhagic insults right frontal and left occipital lobe change over time appears appropriate. 2. Parenchymal volume loss and extensive white matter more the deep gray matter signal abnormalities which may represent chronic ischemic changes 3. Superimposed peripheral foci of susceptibility frontal greater than occipital temporal regions pattern suggestive of amyloid angiopathy. Discussed with Dr. Kasner in neurology 7/12/2013 acknowledged.
