Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

MRI brain: No interval focus of restricted diffusion. No abnormal susceptibility to suggest acute hemorrhage. No midline shift or hydrocephalus. Basal cisterns are patent. Postsurgical changes from prior right sided craniotomy. Susceptibility artifact is seen in the right sylvian fissure and in the region of right posterior communicating artery consistent with clipping. The susceptibility in the region of the left posterior communicating artery is secondary to coil mass. Stable encephalomalacia changes in the anterior right temporal lobe. Following contrast administration no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids appear well pneumatized. MR angiography: Questionable minimal filling of the site of previously surgically clipped right middle cerebral artery aneurysm. No definite evidence of filling at the site of previously treated posterior communicating artery aneurysms within limits of technique. Grossly stable 2-mm left middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm. Note conventional catheter angiography has higher sensitivity for detection of tiny residual filling and small aneurysms. There is normal appearance of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The vertebral arteries vertebrobasilar junction basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries are normal in appearance. There are are no hemodynamically significant stenoses seen within the circle of Willis.
IMPRESSION:

1. No interval acute intracranial findings. 2. Status post clipping and coiling of aneurysms. Questionable minimal filling of the site of previously surgically clipped right middle cerebral artery aneurysm. 3. No definite evidence of filling at the site of previously treated posterior communicating artery aneurysms within limits of technique. 4. Grossly stable 2-mm left middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm.
