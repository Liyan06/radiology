Diseases: ['lipoma']
FINDINGS:

There are stable postsurgical changes from right retromastoid craniotomy and right CPA angle mass resection. There is susceptibility artifact from surgical clip at the right ambient cistern. There is stable mild right middle cerebellar peduncle and cerebellar hemisphere volume loss. There are stable nonspecific T2 hyperintensity in the right inferior medial frontal cortex and subcortical white matter and within the right genu of the corpus callosum. Incidentally noted is made of a lipoma along the roof of the third ventricle/cavum interpositum. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. No extraaxial collection. The intracranial flow voids are otherwise normal. Again seen is decreased flow of the right jugular bulb and sigmoid sinus stable post op change. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. Mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. Interval resolution of bilateral mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post right retromastoid craniotomy and right CP angle mass resection changes without recurrence. 2. Stable nonspecific T2 hyperintensity within the right frontal lobe and right genu of the corpus callosum and incidental lipoma along the roof of the third ventricle/cavum interpositum. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation and agree with the findings in this report.
