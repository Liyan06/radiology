Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

The study is limited due to motion degradation on nearly all sequences. There are a few scattered FLAIR hyperintensities in the deep and subcortical white matter.The ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent but within normal limits for age. There is no mass effect midline shift or edema. There is no intra or extra-axial fluid collections. There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate T1 and T2 hyperintense lesion which appears somewhat expansile involving the right frontal sinus and may represent mucocele vs sinonasal polyp or mucus retention cyst. However if there is history of previous sinus surgery this could represent fat packing although doesn't have typical signal characteristics for fat. There is also mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus. There is also a small mucus retention cyst vs sinonasal polyp in the left maxillary sinus anteriorly. Gradient echo imaging shows no hemosiderin deposition within the brain.
IMPRESSION:

1. Sinus disease as described above. Question if right frontal sinus lesion may represent mucocele as it has slightly expansile appearance but otherwise could represent sinonasal polyp vs mucus retention cyst. If this is the sight of previous surgery alternatively this could represent fat packing and clinical correlation recommended. 2. Otherwise nonspecific few white matter hyperintensities within normal limits for age. Age-related atrophic changes but there is no definite hydrocephalus appreciated.
