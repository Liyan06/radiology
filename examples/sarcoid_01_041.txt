Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

There are subcortical left-sided and periventricular right-sided T2hyperintensities which are nonspecific.Additionally there is also a single focus of enhancement in the leftfrontal lobe with abnormal signal intensity. Given that there is anenhancing lesion the differential diagnositic possibilities includemultiple sclerosis sarcoid vasculitis and lyme disease. Analternate possibility is capillary telangiectasia for the enhancingfocus. Clinical correlation and followup is recommended.The cerebral ventricles cortical sulci and basal cisterns areunremarkable.The right PICA is not visualized but there is a large right AICA. Theleft AICA is not visualized but there is a dominant left PCOM.Basilar artery and major branches are unremarkable.Intracranial portions of both internal carotid arteries and branchesare unremarkable.No aneurysm is seen. Conventional angiography is more sensitive forthe detection of small aneurysms.
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered foci of white matter signal abnormality with enhancinglesion in the right frontal lobe which is not consistent with thesimple white matter lesions which have been described in migraineheadache patients. Diseases involving the white matter includingmultiple sclerosis sarcoidosis vasculitis and lyme disease must beconsidered. Clinical correlation recommended.2. Unremarkable MRA of the circle of Willis.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: BAGLEY LINDA J MD
