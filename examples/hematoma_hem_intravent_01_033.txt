Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter which terminates at the right lateral ventricle. Allowing for differences in technique ventricular dilatation is stable compared to prior CT exam. Susceptibility artifact from aneurysm clip again noted in the right suprasellar region. Changes of right craniotomy (pterional) also again noted. Stable size of right frontal subdural fluid collection with mass effect on the right frontal lobe. Blood products within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles are stable from prior CT examination. Scattered areas of subarachnoid/subdural hemorrhage again noted. No new hemorrhage. No areas of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. Stable opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells fluid in the left sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. No significant interval change from CT examination earlier the same day allowing for differences in technique. 2. Continued ventricular dilatation. 3. Stable post surgical changes with stable intraventricular/subarachnoid/subdural blood. Stable size of right frontal subdural fluid collection with mass effect on the right frontal lobe. No evidence of acute infarction. Attending interpretation: Agree with above. Please note that there is a prominent 3 mm nodule of enhancement in a right occipital sulcus (series 10 image 30 and series 9 image 21). This was discussed with Dr. Sanborn from neurosurgery. Patient does have multiple liver lesions as well and this focal area of enhancement in the right occipital lobe may represent a tiny metastatic deposit. This is new since MRI from February 18 2008. Other etiologies (such as mycotic aneurysm) cannot entirely be excluded and if there is concern for this CT angiography can be considered for additional evaluation.
