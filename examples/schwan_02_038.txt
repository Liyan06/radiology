Diseases: ['schwannoma', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

No internal comparison studies.Ventricles and CSF spaces are symmetric and markedly prominent inexcess of that expected for stated age of 50. The corpus callosumis thin. Posterior fossa structures have also lost volume. Thereare multiple abnormal foci of increased signal intensity onlong-TR images in the white matter in some regions veryperipheral though still probably subcortical. This includes theanterior temporal white matter. These lesions do not appear toenhance.A 2cm enhancing mass is identified in right Meckel's cave possible cavernous sinus component. The carotid is slightlymedially displaced though still patent.There is an approximately 2 cm nonenhancing well-defined lesionin the subcutaneous tissues right suboccipital region likelysebaceous cyst.In the cervical cord there are lesions in the cervical cord at C3and C5 possibly C2.In the thoracic cord there is an apparent lesion at T9 level withprobable lesions at T10 T11 and T11-12.Post contrast imaging of the cervical and thoracic cord isdegraded by motion subtle enhancing lesions could be missedalthough none are convincingly visualized.
IMPRESSION:

1. Marked parenchymal volume loss for stated age of 50 involvingthe supratentorial and posterior fossa structures.2. White matter hyperintensities nonspecific but consistent withthe clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. No convincingenhancement. No comparisons.3. 2 cm probable 5th nerve schwannoma on right. Meningioma isconsidered less likely given the appearance.4. Cervical and thoracic cord lesions no convincing enhancementbut post contrast images of the cord are degraded by motion anddifficult to accurately evaluate for subtle enhancement.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
