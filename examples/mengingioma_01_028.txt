Diseases: ['meningioma', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There are extensive encephalomalacic changes in the bilateral frontal lobes left greater than right right temporal lobe and anterior left temporal lobe with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricles. Superimposed periventricular subcortical and deep white matter T2 signal and amount she is likely the sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. The left paraclinoid lesion noted on the prior CT examination is incompletely evaluated. However on the sagittal images it appears isointense to gray matter and appears to displace the carotid posteriorly. Although this is not definite these findings suggest meningioma. This should be further evaluated when feasible with contrast enhanced MRI/A. Diffusion weighted images demonstrate punctate focus of increased signal intensity in the right parietal lobe (series 3 image 19) not confirmed on the ADC maps but could represent a small focus of ischemia. Susceptibility artifact is present in several areas of encephalomalacia in the right temporal lobe and left frontal lobe particularly likely representing mineralization. There are prominent flow voids at the bilateral MCA bifurcations which could represent tortuous vessels versus small aneurysms. The basilar tip is also prominent.
IMPRESSION:

1. Favor meningioma versus less likely aneurysm left cavernous carotid as above. This should be further evaluated with contrast enhanced MRI/MRA when feasible. 2. Punctate focus of restricted diffusion right parietal lobe not confirmed on ADC maps possibly representing small focus of ischemia. 3. Extensive encephalomalacic change as above. 4. Possible bilateral MCA bifurcation aneurysms versus tortuous vessels. Again MRA would be beneficial for further characterization. Attending review: Agree with above. Contrast-enhanced MRI would also be helpful. No evidence of restricted diffusion.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
