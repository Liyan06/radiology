Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Nonspecific areas of T2 hyperintensity in periventricular and deep white matter bilaterally. This is likely related to small vessel ischemic disease. A left occipital area of encephalomalacia with adjacent small area of flair hyperintensity has not significantly changed since the prior CT. Small area of susceptibility is noted in the left peri-atrial white matter likely related to hemorrhage. There is mineralization of bilateral basal ganglia. There is no acute infarct intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is stable parenchymal volume loss with associated changes in the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear except for mild mucosal thickening in the bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonspecific areas of T2 hyperintensity in bilateral white matter likely related to small vessel ischemic disease. 2. Left occipital area of encephalomalacia. 3. No acute parenchymal brain abnormality. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
