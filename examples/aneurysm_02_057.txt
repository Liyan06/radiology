Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There is a homogeneously hypoenhancing mass in the right greater than left sella/suprasellar region measuring about 1.3 (AP) x 1.7 (TR) by 1.4 (CC) cm compatible with pituitary macroadenoma. The lesion extends into the right cavernous sinus but does not encase it greater than 180Â°. The infundibulum is deviated to the left and normal pituitary gland is apparently displaced inferior and left. No significant mass effect upon the optic chiasm which appears normal. No evidence of parenchymal lesion or midline shift. No intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or hydrocephalus. Cerebral volume is normal for age. No areas of restricted diffusion. No pathologic enhancement within the brain parenchyma. Mucosal thickening noted in the paranasal sinuses with polyp or mucous retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. Trace fluid/inflammation in the right mastoid air cells. Orbits unremarkable. MRA demonstrates antegrade flow and normal caliber of the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries intracranial vertebral arteries and basilar artery and bilateral anterior middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Posterior communicating arteries are seen bilaterally left larger than right. There appears to be a tiny (2 mm) aneurysm involving the posterior genu of the right cavernous internal carotid artery. No significant intracranial stenosis or vascular malformation. MRA is not sensitive for the detection of aneurysms less than 4 mm in diameter.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings compatible with pituitary macroadenoma. 2. No parenchymal brain abnormality. 3. Patency of the intracranial circulation. Probable tiny aneurysm of the right cavernous ICA as described. Findings were discussed with Dr. Halpern on 5/6/2009 at approximately 1:30 a.m. FINAL ATTENDING
