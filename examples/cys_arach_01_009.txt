Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

MRI brain: There is markedly discrepant prominence of the lateral and third ventricles and to a lesser extent the fourth ventricle with respect to the sulci likely representing mild communicating hydrocephalus. A small amount of transependymal flow of CSF may be present. There is a prominent CSF space in the posterior fossa and large cisterna magna versus arachnoid cyst. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are otherwise patent. No mass effect or extra-axial collection. There are scattered foci of increased T2 signal in the white matter likely sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is suggestion of a partially empty sella. The orbits are normal in appearance. There is mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses. MRA head: The bilateral distal internal carotid arteries A1 segments M1 segments and distal ACA and MCA branches are normal in appearance without stenosis or aneurysm. The distal vertebral arteries basilar artery basilar tip and posterior cerebral arteries are normal in appearance without stenosis or aneurysm. Please note that MRA is less sensitive for aneurysms measuring less than 4 mm in diameter. MRA neck: There is a classic arch anatomy. The origins of the great vessels are widely patent. The bilateral common carotid arteries internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries are normal in appearance throughout their cervical course without stenosis or aneurysm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with mild communicating hydrocephalus. Small amount of transependymal flow of CSF may be present. 2. Patent intracranial arterial vasculature. 3. Patent cervical arterial vasculature.
