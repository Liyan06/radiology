Diseases: ['meningitis', 'thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Post surgical change of right ear and mastoidectomy with enhancing tissue in the surgical bed. There is new thick nodular enhancement of the dura subjacent to the right suboccipital temporoparietal craniectomy and flap extending along the right tentorium and right posterior fossa and posterior cranial fossa with some subtle leptomeningeal enhancement concerning for meningitis superimposed on posttreatment change. The scalp flap demonstrates nonspecific heterogeneous enhancement without drainable large abscess. The right sigmoid and transverse sinus demonstrates some interval signal change is since prior brain MRI in 2004 concerning for slow flow or nonocclusive thrombosis. Note is made that on the April 18 2007 contrast enhanced CT neck the sigmoid sinus appears diminished at that time. There is new T2 hyperintensity in the right cerebellum and lateral right temporal lobe similar to brain CT yesterday demontrates no pathologic enhancement or evidence of acute infarct/hemorrhage. Right frontal lobe encephalomalacia is noted. Bilateral internal auditory canal of grossly unremarkable without pathologic enhancement.
IMPRESSION:

1. New thick enhancement of the dura subjacent to the right suboccipital temporoparietal craniectomy and flap extending along the right tentorium and right posterior fossa and posterior cranial fossa with some subtle leptomeningeal enhancement concerning for meningitis superimposed on posttreatment change. Tumor extension is also a concern. 2. Slow flow or thrombosis of the right transverse/sigmoid sinus. Further evaluation with CTV or MRV is recommended. 3. New signal changes in the right temporal lobe could be post-radiation changes. However evolving infarct or venous congestion from progression of right transverse/sigmoid sinus occlusion cannot be excluded.
