Diseases: ['meningitis', 'meningitis']
FINDINGS:

No areas of restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct. The FLAIR scan however is abnormal with loss of the basilar cisterns see image 13 series 4. The patient is intubated however and this could be an effect of oxygen but an underlying meningitis cannot be excluded on the basis of this MR scan. There is stable encephalomalacia in the left occipital lobe with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle consistent with chronic infarct. Extensive T2 prolongation in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres splenium of the corpus callosum and pons which is likely reflective of chronic small vessel disease is unchanged. Focus of susceptibility in the right pons can be identified as a focal of low signal intensity on the B0 diffusion imaging on the prior study indicating unchanged chronic microhemorrhage. There are no findings of acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The brain parenchymal volume is age-appropriate. The The basal cisterns are patent. No abnormal brain parenchymal or leptomeningeal enhancement is evident apart from some enhancement along the medial aspect of the old infarct. Similar finding was visible on the study of August of this year.. The patient is intubated with opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells. Trace mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells and frontal sinuses. Bilateral cataract surgeries.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute infarcts or abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. 2. FLAIR scan is abnormal as above. This could be an artifact of oxygen changes on CSF with intubation but meningitis cannot be excluded and correlate with CSF fluid findings if meningitis is a consideration. 3. Parenchymal enhancement medial left occipital lobe likely related to patient's old infarct  stable compared to the study of August 2013.
