Diseases: ['sarcoidosis', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There is residual signal abnormality seen on flair sequences inthe left caudate nucleus but no evidence of pathologicenhancement. There is a new small area of enhancement measuringapproximately 5 mm in the white matter of the right frontal lobe.There is slight prominence on the enhancement of the pituitarystalk. This is nonspecific may represent normal variant mayalso be encountered with infiltrative processes or granulomatousprocesses such as sarcoidosis.There is suggestion of tiny sub cm areas of abnormal signal aswell as enhancement in the right precentral gyrus seen on image26 28 and the corresponding flair sequences raising suspicionfor pial process likely sarcoidosis in this patient with reportedhistory of sarcoidosis.The cerebral ventricles cortical sulci and basal cisterns areunremarkable. There are no abnormal areas of restricteddiffusion.
IMPRESSION:

1. Complete resolution of the left caudate nucleus enhancement with residual white matter signal abnormality.2. New small linear area of enhancement in the right frontallobe with suggestion of tiny cortical based areas of enhancementin the right precentral gyrus raising suspicion for parenchymaland pial sarcoidosis involvement. CSF sampling may be of help.3. Stable prominence and enhancement of the pituitary stalkwhich may be normal variant may also be encountered withinfiltrative processes or granulomatous processes such assarcoidosis.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
