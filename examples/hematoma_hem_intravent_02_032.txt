Diseases: ['lymphoma']
FINDINGS:

There is again seen findings of bifrontal craniotomy. The bifrontal extra-axial hemorrhagic fluid collections are again seen however are slightly decreased in size on the prior examination. This is most prominent over the superior left cerebral hemisphere where there is significantly decreased mass effect on the underlying brain parenchyma. Mass effect on the right superior cerebral hemisphere is unchanged. The small bilateral frontal hygromas are stable. There is again seen a complex mass closely associated with the interventricular septum that is unchanged in size and configuration from the prior examination. Hemorrhage layering posteriorly within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles is grossly unchanged from the prior study; there is no evidence of hydrocephalus on the current study. There is no new intracranial hemorrhage or extracerebral fluid collection. Dural enhancement is unchanged and likely reactive in nature. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Slightly decreased size of the extra-axial fluid collection underlying the bifrontal craniotomy with decreased mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere. Right cerebral hemisphere mass effect is unchanged. 2. Stable appearance of the midline septal mass consistent with the patient's history of lymphoma. 3. Stable intraventricular hemorrhage.
