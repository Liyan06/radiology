Diseases: ['metastasis']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated are subcentimeter bilateral enhancing lesions with associated susceptibility representing hemorrhagic metastases. Lesions in the subcortical left frontal lobe subcortical right frontoparietal lobe and right cerebellar hemisphere appear approximately stable in size when measured on postcontrast images. Associated edema appears mildly improved. There is a new focus of T2 prolongation in the subcortical left precentral gyrus which appears to have a fleck of tiny associated peripheral enhancement (image 27 series 8) likely representing a new metastasis; small subacute to chronic infarct is also possible. An additional focus of susceptibility in the left Sylvian fissure is again seen without associated enhancement or T2 signal abnormality. There is no evidence of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. Ventricles sulci and cisterns remain symmetric and patent. There are no extra-axial fluid collections. There is mild periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensity which is nonspecific likely the sequela of chronic ischemia. There is no evidence of acute infarct. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable subcentimeter enhancing lesions in the left frontal lobe right frontoparietal lobe and right cerebellar hemisphere likely brain metastases. Associated edema mildly improved. 2. Probable new metastasis in the posterior left frontal lobe; differential includes subacute to chronic infarct. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
