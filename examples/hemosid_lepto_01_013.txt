Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

There is encephalomalacia gliosis and hemosiderin staining in the region of the prior right frontal hematoma. There is no restricted diffusion or acute hemorrhage. There are stable additional areas of hemosiderin staining along the sulci of the left temporoparietal region left occipital lobe bilateral cerebellar folia and right basal ganglia. There are stable nonspecific foci of T2 prolongation within the bilateral white matter. Redemonstrated is a small region of encephalomalacia within the right cerebellum. Cerebellar tonsils project to foramen magnum similar to prior examination. There is cerebral volume loss greater than expected for the patient's age. The ventricles and CSF spaces are otherwise stable. The paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Stable evolutionary changes from prior right frontal hematoma. 3. Hemosiderin staining of the right basal ganglia and cerebellar folia with superficial siderosis of the left temporoparietal region and left occipital lobe. 4. Nonspecific foci of T2 prolongation within the bilateral white matter. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
