Diseases: ['sarcoidosis', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There are scattered punctate foci of T2 hyperintenisty in thesubcortical and deep white matter. There is no associated mass effector enhancement. These findings are unchanged and compatible with butnot characteristic of demyelinating disease.The ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and normal in size.No extraaxial fluid collection or mass effect is identified.Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation aswell as the superior sagittal sinus.Pituitary fossa posterior fossa and both orbits are unremarkable.No abnormal enhancing lesions are identified.There is loss of normal cervical lordosis.C4-5: There is a diffuse right paracentral disc herniation with anannular tear. There is right uncovertebral joint disease with rightneural foraminal narrowing. There is mild central canal stenosis.C5-6: There is a left paracentral disc herniation with annular tear.There is mild central stenosis with left neural foraminal narrowing.C6-7: There is a left paracentral disc herniation with annular tear.This causes central stenosis with indentation of the spinal cord.There is a mild scoliosis convex to the right in the thoracic spine.There is focal increased T1 weighted signal intensity in the T3 and T8vertebral bodies focal fat versus hemangiomas.The cervical and thoracic spinal cord is normal in signal intensityand morphology. The conus medullaris is located at L1. There is nopathologic enhancement in the central canal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable nonspecific punctate foci of T2 hyperintensity in thebrain. While these changes are consistent with demyelinating disease they are not characteristic. The differential diagnosis includesischemic changes sarcoidosis Lyme disease trauma or infection.2. Normal spinal cord.3. Degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine with neuralforaminal narrowing as described above.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: BAGLEY LINDA J MD
