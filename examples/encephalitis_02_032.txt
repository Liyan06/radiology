Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Multiple images are severely degraded by motion artifact. There are scattered foci of high T2/FLAIR signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter nonspecific. Mild abnormal T2/FLAIR signal in the medial thalami bilaterally. Ventricles and sulci are appropriate for age. No mass lesion no extra-axial collection and no acute ischemia. No obvious abnormal enhancement given motion artifact. The paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Severely motion degraded study. 2. Mild abnormal signal in the medial thalami bilaterally. Differentially considerations include Wernicke's encephalopathy viral encephalitis seizure activity and venous ischemia. Clinical correlation advised.
