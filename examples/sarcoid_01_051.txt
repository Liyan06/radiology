Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Unchanged dural based enhancing mass measuring approximately 11mm lateral to the right anterior clinoid process most consistent with a meningioma. Redemonstrated are multiple foci of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter without enhancement the largest largest lesion measuring 11 mm in right centrum semiovale (image 22 of series 4) which are nonspecific and can be seen in a spectrum of inflammatory and vascular processes. Unchanged signal abnormality involving gray and white matter in the right occipital lobe that is likely sequela of prior infarct. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain. The intracranial flow voids are normal. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. No parenchymal pathologic enhancement. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Unchanged 11 mm dural based mass lateral to1 the right anterior clinoid process that is most consistent with a meningioma. 2. Unchanged multiple foci of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter without enhancement the largest largest lesion measuring 11 mm in right centrum semiovale (image 22 of series 4) which are nonspecific and can be seen in a spectrum of inflammatory and vascular processes for which clinical correlation is advised. 3. Unchanged signal abnormality involving gray and white matter in the right occipital lobe likely sequela of old infract. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
