Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated is a 16 mm well-circumscribed round lesion in the medial left temporal lobe which is T1 hyperintense T2 hypointense and has marked susceptibility. The size shape and signal characteristics are essentially unchanged from 2009 and very similar dating to 1998. There is similar minimal mass-effect on temporal horn left lateral ventricle. There are two adjacent non-specific foci of susceptibility present in the posterior aspect of left frontal centrum semiovale; the more lateral these appears new from 2009 exam. Scattered foci of T2 prolongation are again noted in the bilateral periventricular deep and subcortical white matter nonspecific probably sequela of chronic small vessel ischemia similar to prior exam. Similar patchy T2 hyperintensities are present within the pons also probably ischemic in origin. No extra-axial fluid collections or mass effect. No restricted diffusion. Ventricular and sulcal caliber are within normal limits for patient age. Ethmoidal and to lesser degree maxillary mucosal changes. No suspicious marrow signal changes. Orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearing 16-mm lesion within the medial aspect left temporal lobe with marked susceptibility T1 hyperintensity minimal mass-effect and no apparent edema. Given its stability the studies are most consistent with a cavernous angioma. Thrombosed aneurysm felt to be unlikely given its gross stability since 1998. 2. Sequela of microvascular ischemic changes as detailed. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation and agree with the findings in this report.
