Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarcts. No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain or its covering. There is age-appropriate volume loss. Redemonstrated are extensive subcortical periventricular and deep white matter flair hyperintensities a nonspecific finding but in this patient's age group commonly associated with chronic small vessel ischemic change. Old bilateral basal ganglia infarcts also identified. Projecting over the right frontal convexity is a homogeneously enhancing 2.4 x 1.1 cm extra-axial mass with adjacent dural enhancement. This corresponds to the focal region of osseous erosion identified on recent head CT examination. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as the superior sagittal sinus. Bilateral lens placement. Mucosal changes identified in the bilateral frontal and sphenoid sinuses. Redemonstrated is complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus. Mild mucosal changes identified in the ethmoid air cells (see left greater than right.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute intracranial process. 2. Sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic change and prior basal ganglia infarcts. 3. Enhancing 2.4 x 1.1 cm right frontal extra-axial mass imaging features support a meningioma. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST ADDITION: I agree with the preliminary report with the following additions: The body of the report sould not read " No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain or its covering" as there is the described enhancing 2.4 x 1.1 cm right frontal meningioma. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
