Diseases: ['metastasis']
FINDINGS:

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. No acute infarct. Nonspecific areas of confluent and focal periventricular deep white matter and subcortical T2/hyperintensities also in the brainstem especially the pons possibly related to small vessel changes. Cerebral volume is decreased. No pathologic enhancement in the brain or its covering. Again seen is a focal defect in the right anterior calvarium just posterior to the coronal suture with thinning of the calvarium and outward bowing and expansion of the underlying CSF space. There is some enhancement along the periphery of the defect. Prior bilateral cataract surgeries. Mild paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. Trace fluid in left mastoid air cells. Mild heterogeneity of marrow signal including the posterior portion of the clivus but no suspicious lesion is convincingly seen.
IMPRESSION:

1. No enhancing parenchymal lesion to suggest brain metastases. 2. Focal calvarial defect/outpouching with a non-aggressive appearance just posterior to the right coronal suture could perhaps represent sequela of prior trauma (so-called "growing fracture" seen in youth) and/or CSF pulsation or even perhaps a small arachnoid cyst with adjacent enhancement of dural veins. Favor benign etiology but a focal metastasis is not completely excluded. Advise correlation with history; comparison to outside prior studies would be helpful. In the abscence of this attention should be paid to this area on follow-up examinations.
