Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric minimally prominent for stated age of 32 with specific note made of apparently small pons and medulla. Cerebellar folia may be slightly prominent but no striking volume loss or least no discordant volume loss compared to rest of brain. Within limits of series acquired mesial temporal lobes appear fairly symmetric in size and signal intensity though this does not constitute a complete evaluation with regard to complex partial seizures. No convincing heterotopias are appreciated within these limits. There is nonvisualization of a flow void in the right internal carotid artery incompletely evaluated. This is abnormal for stated age of 32. Vertebral basilar system and left anterior circulation appear to show normal flow voids as does right anterior circulation at supraclinoid internal carotid artery and above. Diffusion-weighted images show no acute findings.
IMPRESSION:

1. Only sagittal T1-weighted axial T2-weighted and axial diffusion-weighted images could be obtained as the patient could not tolerate scanning at either 3 Tesla or 1.5 Tesla in wide-bore scanners. 2. Nonvisualization of flow void distal right cervical internal carotid artery petrous or cavernous carotid artery with flow void appreciated distal supraclinoid internal carotid artery and above. Other flow voids within normal limits for age. Suspect occlusion or high-grade stenosis right internal carotid artery less likely agenesis or atresia. Consider CT angiography for further evaluation. 3. Decreased volume pons and brainstem possible superimposed diffuse global volume loss as well for age. Correlate for possible degenerative process such as olivopontocerebellar degeneration. Chronic antiseizure medication could also play a role. Discussed with Dr. Anderson Jan. 22 2009.
