Diseases: ['meningitis']
FINDINGS:

Susceptibility artifact is noted along the left frontal scalp.Hypodensity seen throughout the calvarial bone marrow this mayindicate marrow infiltrative process versus red marrow.There is a 9 mm T2/FLAIR hyperintensity noted along the leftposterior frontal lobe cortex near the midline (series 4 image26). This region demonstrates no evidence of enhancement and doesrestrict on diffusion weighted sequences. Findings are consistentwith a small cortical infarction.Faint enhancement is noted along the surface of the midbrain.There is also a suggestion of enhancement along the inferior sulciof the cerebellum. This may represent either prominentvasculature versus true pial enhancement. Clinically correlate.The mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air cells. There isfluid and mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus and rightfrontal sinus. Retention cyst versus polyp is noted in the leftmaxillary sinus. There is fluid in the bilateral mastoid air cellsand nasopharynx.The ventricles and vascular flow voids are unremarkable. Theright vertebral artery is dominant.
IMPRESSION:

1. Small 9 mm area of acute cortical infarct along the leftposterior frontal lobe.2. Prominent vasculature versus true pial enhancement along thesurface of the midbrain and inferior sulci of the cerebellum.This may indicate underlying meningitis clinically correlate.3. Marrow infiltrative process versus red marrow in thecalvarium.4. Fluid and mucosal thickening within the sinuses and mastoidair cells as detailed above.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
