Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

There are areas of T2 and T1 hyperintensity in the left coronaradiata. This area shows decreased diffusion. There is minimalinvolvement of the posterior limb of the left internal capsule.Findings are consistent with acute/subacute infarction with smallamount of hemorrhage. There is a 2 mm T1 bright focus in the deepright parietal white matter possibly a small focus ofperiventricular leukomalacia.There is minimal T1 hyperintensity along the dura of the posteriorfossa and occipital lobes consistent with trace subduralhemorrhage which is not an unexpected finding status post vaginaldelivery. Cerebral cortex is unremarkable. The ventricles arenondilated and basilar cisterns are patent.
IMPRESSION:

1. Area of signal abnormality in the left corona radiata withinvolvement of the posterior limb left internal capsule which isvery likely the sequela of acute/subacute infarction with smallamount of hemorrhage. Questionable tiny focus of periventricularleukomalacia deep right parietal white matter.2. Minimal subdural hemorrhage in the posterior fossa andoccipital region.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
