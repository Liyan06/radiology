Diseases: ['sarcoidosis', 'lymphoma', 'schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Conventional MRI: There is a T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesion in the right thalamus extending to the right midbrain without restricted diffusion measuring 10 x 8 x 8mm. There is no significant local mass effect. There is mild FLAIR hyperintensity extending slightly more caudally in the right midbrain possibly representing vasogenic edema. There is a T2 hyperintense lesion in the right parietal white matter as well as in the left parietal periventricular region. Findings are nonspecific. In the right cerebellopontine angle there is enhancing mass measuring 6 x 5 mm without dural enhancement. There is mild expansion of the right internal auditory canal. Findings likely represents a vestibular schwannoma. Fluid in the right mastoid air cells. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear except for mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. Perfusion imaging: There is no appreciable elevated perfusion in the right thalami lesion. Short and intermediate TE multi-voxel proton MR spectroscopy: No convincing elevation of the choline to NAA ratio.
IMPRESSION:

1. Small enhancing lesion in the inferior right thalamus and the right midbrain. No elevated perfusion or elevated choline to NAA ratio on spectroscopy. The findings are nonspecific but favor inflammatory conditions such as demyelination sarcoidosis or chronic infection. However malignancy (e.g. lymphoma) is not excluded. Recommend short-term follow-up contrast enhanced MRI. 2. Enhancing lesion in the right internal auditory canal most likely representing a vestibular schwannoma. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation and agree with the findings in this report.
