Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

There has been interval evolution of previously seen foci of diffusion restriction with associated T2 hyperintensity. There are no new foci of diffusion restriction. There are two small foci of susceptibility effect in the right occipital lobe and right basal ganglia which in a patient this may reflect foci of hypertensive microhemorrhage not associated with prior diffusion bright lesions. Redemonstrated is extensive nonspecific nonenhancing periventricular deep and subcortical white matter signal abnormality with scattered foci of encephalomalacia in the corona radiata bilaterally reflecting in sequela of small vessel ischemic change with superimposed lacunar infarcts. There is no acute infarct acute intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial collection mass effect or mass lesion. The cerebral volume loss with compensatory enlargement of the ventricles and sulci. There is no pathologic enhancement of the brain parenchyma or its coverings. Probable stable developmental venous anomaly right occipital lobe. Old fracture of the right lamina papyracea with each coronal fat and medial rectus herniating into the air cells. Mild pansinus mucosal thickening. Bilateral concha bullosa right greater than left. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate expect signal void related to vascular flow. Right vertebral artery dominant.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial process seen. 2. Interval evolution of previous small infarcts. 3. Probable chronic microvascular ischemic change with superimposed old lacunar infarcts. Cerebral volume loss. Foci of susceptibility likely hypertensive micro hemorrhage but cannot exclude other etiologies including amyloid angiopathy. 4. Old right medial orbital wall fracture.
