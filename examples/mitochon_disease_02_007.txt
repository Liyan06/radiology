Diseases: ['cadasil', 'encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

The previously seen decreased diffusion of the right parietal and occipital lobes has decreased in conspicuity since the prior examination. Additional foci of abnormal restricted diffusion of the left centrum semi ovale are similarly less prominent. There remains a subtle cortical thickening and hyperintensity on the flair sequences of the right parietal and temporal lobes as well as right hippocampus stable from the prior study. Multiple areas of T2 and flair hyperintensity of the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres are stable most concordant with chronic small vessel ischemic change. No new areas of restricted diffusion or signal alteration are identified. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Incidental note is made of a subcentimeter pineal cyst. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Decreased conspicuity of diffusion abnormalities of the right parietal and occipital lobes with stable subtle cortical thickening and increased signal of the right parietal and temporal regions as described. The findings are nonspecific as described on the prior examination. Sequela of seizure activity are again considered as are vasculitis and chronic disorders such as mitochondrial abnormalities or CADASIL. 2. Periventricular and subcortical white matter abnormalities which may be related to the cortical abnormalities above or the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST ADDITION: I agree with the preliminary report with the following additions: In addition to the above possibilities encephalitis may also have this cortical/subcortical abnormality so correlation with lumbar puncture is suggested.
