Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Utilizing a 3 Tesla unit MRI of the brain was performed and included the following sequences: sagittal T1-weighted axial fast spin echo T2-weighted axial FLAIR axial diffusion weighted and enhanced axial and coronal T1-weighted images. 12 milliliters of MultiHance was injected intravenously.
IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of intra-axial leptomeningeal and dural neoplasm around the resection bed as detailed above. 2. Neoplasm extensively involves the right ICA terminus and MCA. Focal diffusion hyperintensity with peripheral enhancement in the right lateral temporal lobe most likely reflects a subacute infarct. 3. Worsening hydrocephalus likely communicating with mild transependymal edema. Urgent evaluation for ventriculostomy recommended.
