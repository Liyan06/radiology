Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple punctate nonenhancing foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity in periventricular subcortical and deep white matter of the frontal and parietal lobes. This is a non-specific finding. The FLAIR images demonstrate increased signal in the sulci particularly in the posterior parietal and occipital lobes on both sides. No abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. No acute infarction intracranial hemorrhage masses midline shift extra-axial collection or abnormal foci of enhancement in the brain parenchyma. Again identified is volume loss in the cerebellum unchanged. No abnormal foci of susceptibility in the brain parenchyma. The left orbital intraconal mass is again identified that has increased T2 signal intensity and avid enhancement. Comparison is made to head CT dated October 12 2005 and it has slightly increased in size in the interval. Differential diagnosis remains cavernous hemangioma and schwannoma. There is patent intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. There are no regions of focal stenosis. Fetal origin of bilateral posterior cerebral arteries. There is no intracranial aneurysm. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 4 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Increased signal in the sulci on FLAIR images in the posterior parietal and occipital lobes on both sides. This finding is suspicious for proteinaceous material in the CSF spaces. Correlation with CSF sampling is recommended. 2. Unremarkable MR angiogram of the brain. 3. Left orbital intraconal mass. Differential diagnosis remains cavernous hemangioma or schwannoma.
