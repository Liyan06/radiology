Diseases: ['cadasil']
FINDINGS:

There is diffuse extensive white matter signal abnormality involving predominantly the subcortical but also the periventricular and deep white matter including the subcortical white matter of both temporal poles. Some of these regions are associated with cysts/encephalomalacic foci. There is no diffusion restriction. There is no pathologic enhancement following administration of intravenous gadolinium. There are multiple ependymal gray matter heterotopias. There is extra-axial CSF intensity structure overlying both cerebellar hemispheres which does not diffusion restrict consistent with arachnoid cyst. There is no acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Perfusion imaging demonstrates no focal areas of elevated or diminished relative cerebral blood volume. Spectroscopic analysis demonstrates elevated lipid-lactate peaks on some voxels. No evidence of neoplastic process. MRV demonstrates patent dural venous sinuses including the superior sagittal sinus transverse sinuses sigmoid sinuses and straight sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multifocal white matter signal abnormality predominantly involving the subcortical but also the periventricular and deep white matter including involvement of both temporal poles left greater than right with associated cystic/encephalomalacic foci. No associated diffusion restriction susceptibility effects or abnormal perfusion. In a patients this age findings can be seen with CADASIL demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis vasculitis/vasculopathies. Neoplastic process is unlikely given imaging characteristics. 2. Ependymal gray matter heterotopias. 3. Posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. 4. Patent dural venous sinuses.
