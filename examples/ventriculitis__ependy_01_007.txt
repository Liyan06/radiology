Diseases: ['hematoma', 'gliosis', 'hematoma']
FINDINGS:

There is blood products in the posterior fossa on theright side related to patient's original trauma. There areassociated post surgical changes related to suboccipitalcraniectomy. There is thin surrounding enhancement compatiblewith evolving hematoma. There is hemorrhage in left frontal lobealong the shunt tract which demonstrates a thick rim enhancementextending beyond the margins of the hematoma which may representevolving hematoma although superimposed infection of the hematomais not excluded. Clinical correlation recommended. There issurrounding T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe which mayrepresent gliosis or edema. The right ventriculostomy cathetercrosses the midline and terminates in the left lateral ventricle.There is hemorrhage along the septum pellucidum extending to thegenu of the corpus callosum and probably subependymal the in theleft frontal horn possibly related to ventricular catheterplacement. There is small amount of blood in the atria of thelateral ventricles. Subtle adjacent ependymal enhancement ispresent and ependymitis cannot be entirely excluded. Theventricles are enlarged unchanged from CT examination of thismorning. There is complete opacification of the right maxillary left frontal and left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Blood products and post surgical changes in the rightposterior fossa.2. Thick rim enhancement involving the left frontal lobehematoma which may represent evolving hematoma. Superimposedinfection cannot be excluded and clinical correlation recommended.3. Hemorrhage and gliosis in both frontal lobes along the shunttracts. Hematoma along the corpus callosum and septum pellucidumrelated to right ventricular shunt catheter.4. Subtle ependymal enhancement ependymitis cannot be entirelyexcluded.5. Ventriculomegaly unchanged from CT of this morning.6. Stable opacification of the sinuses.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
