Diseases: ['schwannoma', 'hemangioblastoma']
FINDINGS:

Again seen are multiple bilateral enhancing masses throughout the posterior fossa which appear grossly unchanged from the prior April exam. There is again seen extensive signal abnormality in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres likely representing a combination of encephalomalacia and edema. There is stable ex vacuo dilatation of the fourth ventricle. Again seen is a 3 mm enhancing nodule in the left internal auditory canal which could be a vestibular schwannoma or an additional hemangioblastoma. There are stable postoperative changes from a prior right suboccipital craniectomy and prior left suboccipital craniectomy. A stable extra-axial fluid collection in the left lateral posterior fossa is present. The orbits are normal. The paranasal sinuses are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple hemangioblastomas in posterior fossa stable from exam performed one month prior. 2. A 3-mm enhancing nodule in left internal auditory canal which could be a vestibular schwannoma or additional hemangioblastoma. 3. Stable post-operative changes in the posterior fossa. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
