Diseases: ['hematoma', 'metastasis', 'cerebritis']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is evidence of a moderate communicatinghydrocephalus with transependymal CSF flow.There is a 1.5 x 1.2 cm intraparenchymal hematoma with surroundingedema. The lesion is bright on T1 and bright on T2 indicatingextracellular methemoglobin. Because of the T1-brightness enhancement cannot be assessed and a hemorrhagic metastasiscannot be excluded. Follow-up in 4 weeks is recommended forfurther evaluation.Superior to the hematoma in the left frontal lobe there is aregion of edema which does not seem to be contiguous to thehematoma that could be related to an old trauma.There are small subdural hematomas in bilateral frontal leftparietal and left temporal lobes.There is a FLAIR-bright area in the left parietal lobe that couldrepresent focal cerebritis or edema. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posteriorcirculation as well as the superior sagittal sinus.Pituitary fossa posterior fossa and both orbits areunremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Small left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma with nodefinite enhancement. Hemorrhagic metastasis cannot be excluded.Follow-up in 4 weeks is advised.2. Subdural hematomas in bilateral in bilateral frontal leftparietal and left temporal lobes.3. Possible left parietal lobe cerebritis .4. Continued moderate communicating hydrocephalus.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
