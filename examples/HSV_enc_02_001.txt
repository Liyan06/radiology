Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There is swelling in the hippocampal and parahippocampal left temporal lobe which is increased in T2 signal with slight enhancement on postcontrast images in the hippocampus. There is also slight expansion and increased signal in the gyri of the remainder of the left temporal lobe cortex anteriorly and laterally There is decreased diffusion most evident in the hippocampus and probably in temporal cortex to a lesser extent. In the left precentral gyrus best seen on image 28 of series 6 there is a slightly expansile ill defined area of slightly increased T2 signal with a subcortical "tail" which does not enhance or demonstrate restricted diffusion. Cortex appears dysmorphic in this region. There is slight asymmetry of the lateral ventricles with the right greater than left in size. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. There is mild diffuse cerebellar atrophy. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Subtly expansile ill defined area of increased signal with subcortical tail in the left precentral gyrus favor that this represents an area of cortical dysplasia. A low grade neoplasm while not excluded is less likely. 2. Abnormal signal and restricted diffusion in the left temporal lobe greatest in the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. This most likely represent sequela of an ictal or peri-ictal state. Other etiologies such as herpes encephalitis could have a similar appearance in the appropriate clinical setting but felt to be less likely in discussing case with Dr. Christina Wilson on June 2 2010 at 1512 hrs.
