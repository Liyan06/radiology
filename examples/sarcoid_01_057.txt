Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

Asymmetric enhancement of the distal intracanulicular/labyrinthe segment of right seventh nerve. Cochlea and semicircular canal characteristics are within normal limits. There is no other convincing enhancement of other cranial nerves. There is no convincing evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement. No diffusion restriction. No extra-axial fluid collections. No suspicious intraparenchymal or meningeal enhancement. Innumerable T2/FLAIR hyperintensities within the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter which are nonspecific however likely reflective of microvascular ischemic disease. Mild parenchymal volume loss without disproportionate ventriculomegaly. Imaged vascular flow voids are within normal limits. No focal regions of mass effect. Partial empty sella is suggested. The visualized paranasal sinuses and orbits are normal. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. Bilateral maxillary mucous retention cysts. Ethmoidal and maxillary mucosal changes. Orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonspecific focal enhancement distal intracanulicular/labrynthine portion of right seventh nerve. Differential considerations include inflammatory/infectious etiologies such as viral possibly Lyme disease sarcoidosis or vasculitis. Neoplastic etiologies such as schwannomas or perineural spread of malignancy are not entirely excluded but are thought to be less likely given the acute presentation. Follow-up imaging may be performed as clinically warranted. 2. No evidence of acute ischemia. Sequela of microvascular ischemic disease as above.
