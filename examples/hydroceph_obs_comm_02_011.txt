Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

As on the CT diffuse signal abnormality demonstrated in the right basal ganglia and right corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle suggesting chronicity. No diffusion-weighted abnormality is seen in this region. A small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage remains predominantly right-sided with the largest focus in the right frontoparietal region toward the convexity. There is a suggestion of a possible layer in the right lateral ventricles occipital horn possibly hemorrhage but this is less certain. The ventricles are disproportionately enlarged involving the lateral and third ventricles. Given the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage this could represent communicating hydrocephalus. There is no mass effect or midline shift. An equivocal focus of possible restricted diffusion is suggested in the anterior right frontal lobe with hypointensity corresponding on the ADC images. There is no T1 hyperintensity to suggest hemorrhage in this region. While not certain acute ischemia is possible. Attention on follow-up imaging is suggested. There are scattered foci of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical periventricular white matter in keeping with sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. Intracranial flow voids are maintained. There is no pathological enhancement of the brain or its coverings.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with chronic infarction of the right basal ganglia and corona radiata.2. Equivocal focus of possible restricted diffusion in the anterior right frontal lobe potentially representing acute ischemia but this is not certain. Attention on follow-up imaging is suggested.3. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage and findings suggesting communicating hydrocephalus.4. Sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.
