Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Again seen are three nonspecific foci of increased T2/FLAIRsignal two in right frontal lobe and one in the left frontallobe unchanged since the previous study. There is also a focusof increased FLAIR signal at the callososeptal interface seen beston the sagittal FLAIR images. These foci do not show enhancementon post gadolinium images. The sulci and cisterns are symmetricand patent.The ventricles are top normal in size for the patient's age. Noextraaxial fluid collections or mass effect.Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posteriorcirculation as well as the superior sagittal sinus.Pituitary fossa posterior fossa and both orbits areunremarkable.No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain or its covering.Diffusion weighted imaging demonstrates no acute ischemia.
IMPRESSION:

1. Three foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal two in right frontallobe and one in the left frontal lobe unchanged since theprevious study. There is also a focus of increased FLAIR signalat the callososeptal interface seen best on the sagittal FLAIRimages. These foci do not demonstrate contrast enhancement.These findings are nonspecific and may represent demyelinatingdisease among other etiologies including Lyme disease vasculitisor sarcoid.2. Top normal sized ventricles for age.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
