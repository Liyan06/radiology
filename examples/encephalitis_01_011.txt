Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There has been interval development of increased signal intensity in the lateral putamen bilaterally on long-TR images. There is no corresponding enhancement with gadolinium. There is no associated mass effect or decrease in diffusion. There are changes of prior left frontotemporal craniotomy. There is stable asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres right larger than left with associated ex vacuo dilation of the left ventricle. There is stable atrophy of the left frontal lobe and there appears to have been prior partial anterior left temporal lobectomy with associated ex vacuo dilation of the CSF spaces and malacia left temporal lobe. There is stable increased signal of the subcortical white matter of the left cerebral hemisphere which has evolved since 11/12/06 in the left parietal lobe cortex. There is also stable periventricular hyperintensity.There is stable asymmetry of the orbits left globe appears enophthalmic. The basilar cisterns remain symmetric. There is no extraaxial fluid collection or mass effect.Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as the superior sagittal sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval development of increased signal intensity in the putamina bilaterally. No corresponding enhancement with gadolinium and no associated mass effect. The etiology is uncertain see above. Differential diagnosis includes prior hypoxic/anoxic event metabolic derangement drug toxicity and perhaps infection such as viral encephalitis (consider CMV). 2. Stable decreased volume of left cerebral hemisphere and malacic changes in the left frontal and temporal lobes as detailed above.3. Progression of bilateral mastoid opacification and paranasal sinus disease. Findings discussed with Dr. Herman.
