Diseases: ['empyema']
FINDINGS:

New right 1cm thick posterior hemispheric subdural collection with either proteinaceous/hemorrhagic content and intrinsic T1 shortening. Evaluation for rim-enhancement is challenging due to the intrinsic signal. There is local mass effect on the right posterior front parietal temporal and occipital lobes but no midline shift and basal cisterns are patent. No underlying parenchymal edema is seen. There are areas of encephalomalacia/volume loss in the right posterior temporoparietal region also effecting portions of right occipital lobe and thalamus similar to prior exam. Right Wallerian degeneration. Exvacuodilatation of the posterior body and atrium of the right lateral ventricle. Ventricles otherwise stable in size. Other scattered white matter foci of T2 prolongation similar to prior exam. No definite abnormal enhancement. Old left medial orbital wall fracture with herniated intraorbital fat similar to prior exam. Mucosal changes in left maxillary sinus with mucous retention cyst or polyp. Mild mucosal changes and other paranasal sinuses. Possible small right nasal dermoid similar to previously. Frontal sinuses are hypoplastic.
IMPRESSION:

1. New right partial hemispheric subdural collection with proteinaneous content. This could represent a new subdural hemorrhage or subdural empyema with local mass effect but no midline shift. 2. Old right posterior hemispheric and deep nucleus encephalomalcia as above. Discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Crino on 6/26/09 at 12pm.
