Diseases: ['hematoma', 'hematoma']
FINDINGS:

The cervical spine study is limited due to patient motion. Th Normal vertebral body height. There is multilevel degenerative disease from C3 through C7 with spinal stenosis extending from C3-C5. Level descriptions are as follows: C3/4: posterior disk bulge bilateral facet hypertrophy complete effacement of the subarachnoid space narrowing of the right neural foramen patent left neural foramen C4/5: Disk space narrowing grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 facet hypertrophy near complete effacement of the subarachnoid space. There is T2 prolongation noted within the marrow space of the bodies of C4 and C5. There is marked sclerosis of these bodies noted on the CT scan are present in this is a reflection of inflammatory marrow edema related to severe osteoarthritis. C5/6: Disk space narrowing facet hypertrophy mild effacement of the subarachnoid space. C6/7: Minimal posterior disk bulge facet hypertrophy minimal effacement of the subarachnoid space. While there is T2 prolongation in the soft tissues dorsal to the spinal canal there is no disruption of the tectorial membrane or abnormal alignment. The two week interval from the time of trauma however decreases the sensitivity of MR and the overall limited image quality makes it difficult to rule out an underlying ligamentous injury on the basis of this exam.
IMPRESSION:

1. Non diagnostic scan for ligamentous injury; see comment 2. Spinal stenosis extending from C3 to C6 which appears to be due to severe degenerative change. 3. Multiple acute cerebral infarctions as described presumably secondary to cardiac emboli. 4. Stable Left frontal parenchymal hematoma small right frontal subdural hematoma see above
