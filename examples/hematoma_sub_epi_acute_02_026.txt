Diseases: ['contusion']
FINDINGS:

BRAIN: Again seen are scattered foci of susceptibility corresponding to hyperintense signal on FLAIR sequences compatible with contusions in the left frontal convexity right inferior temporal lobe and in the right inferior tegmentum. In addition there are additional small foci of susceptibility seen near the grey-white matter junction which may represent additional contusions. Given the location of these at the gray-white junction diffuse axonal injury could be considered. A small collection of subdural blood is noted in the region of the posterior interhemispheric falx. Foci of susceptibility seen along the sulci of the left convexity is compatible with evolving subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is because of the thickening of the paranasal sinuses with notable fluid in the mastoid air cells. A left posterior scalp hematoma with overlying skin staples causing metal artifact is also noted. Flow voids are maintained. There is no pathologic enhancement. C-SPINE: There is persistent high T2 signal in the ligamentum nuchae compatible with ligamentum nuchae injury. The previously seen edema anterior to the C2 through C5 vertebral bodies has resolved. There is no signal abnormality within the bone marrow. There is no signal abnormality within the spinal cord or evidence of spinal cord compression. Multilevel degenerative changes including disc osteophyte complexes are seen at C4/C5 and C5/C6.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable foci of contusion. See above. Small evolving subdural and subarchnoid hemorrhage. No new areas of hemorrhage or evidence of acute infarct. 2. Ligamentum nuchae injury unchanged 3. Resolved edema about the anterior longitudinal ligament
