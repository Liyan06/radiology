Diseases: ['craniopharyngioma']
FINDINGS:

There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Redemonstration of diffuse parenchymal volume loss slightly prominent for the patient's age. Stable scattered foci of T2 prolongation throughout the cerebral white matter nonspecific but likely related to chronic small vessel and perfusional ischemic disease. No diffusion abnormalities or pathologic enhancement in the brain parenchyma. Redemonstration of a 5-6 mm T1 and T2 hyperintense lesion at the dorsal surface of the anterior pituitary gland. No significant deviation of the pituitary stalk. No mass effect upon the optic chiasm or the cavernous sinuses. Enhancement pattern is difficult to evaluate given the intrinsic T1 hyperintensity. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are essentially clear. Orbits unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Stable findings of parenchymal atrophy and sequela of small vessel and perfusional ischemic disease. 3. Stable 5-6 mm sellar lesion as described. Enhancement pattern is difficult to evaluate given the intrinsic T1 hyperintensity. Differential diagnosis remains as before including Rathke's cleft cyst pars intermedia cyst microadenoma or small craniopharyngioma. Follow up is recommended.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
