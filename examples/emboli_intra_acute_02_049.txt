Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left fronto-parietal lobes with surrounding vasogenic edema. There is local mass effect including sulcal effacement mild compression of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. Diffusion weighted imaging is negative. There is no extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Periventricular and subcortical white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are nonspecific but likely represent sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. Axial gradient echo susceptibility images demonstrate a small area of old blood products in the posterior left putamen and in the left parietal occipital lobe. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. The patient is status-post bilateral cataract extraction. The mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Given differences in modality no significant change in the left frontoparietal lobe hemorrhage with surrounding edema and mass effect. There are no definite areas of enhancement however enhancement can be obscured by the large amount of blood products that are hyperintense on unenhanced T1-weighted imaging. I favor that the imaging findings are consistent with amyloid angiopathy or hemorrhage into a small distal embolus in this patient with atrial fibrillation on coumadin; however this is a diagnosis of exclusion and follow-up MRI in four weeks is recommended when the blood products and mass effect have resolved to exclude the possibility of a small mass or vascular malformation.2. Nonspecific white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities likely reflecting chronic small vessel ischemic disease.Results were discussed with Dr. Harrison at 11 PM on 4/24/07.
