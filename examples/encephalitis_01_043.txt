Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Motion limits detail. Diagnostic information is available within these limits. In the parenchyma the ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and probably within normal limits in volume for stated age of 75. Question faint increased intensity right greater than left hippocampus and anteromedial temporal cortex as well as insular cortex on FLAIR images but this is not convincing on T2 weighted images. On diffusion-weighted images there is no acute findings are apparent. No convincing abnormal parenchymal or meningeal enhancement. Right intradural vertebral artery appears to terminate in PICA. Major proximal intracranial arterial branches are otherwise patent and unremarkable circle of Willis configuration appears complete. No evidence of occlusion or high-grade stenosis within limits of normal motion degradation no aneurysm detected. In the neck common origin of innominate and left common carotid artery noted. Motion limits some detail but cervical vessels appear patent right vertebral artery small and terminates in PICA as noted above.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute findings in the brain motion limits some detail. Question subtle increased intensity on FLAIR images right hippocampus and possibly left possibly insular cortex but this is not convincing on T2-weighted or other images specifically no diffusion abnormalities or abnormal enhancement. This is probably artifactual any clinical signs of limbic encephalitis? Discussed with Dr. Smith in neurology 11/17/2012. 2. Unremarkable MR angiogram circle of Willis motion limits some detail. 3. Unremarkable MR angiogram neck motion limits some detail.
