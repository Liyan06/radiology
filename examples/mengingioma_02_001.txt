Diseases: ['meningioma', 'schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Right suboccipital craniectomy with encephalomalacia and gliosis right greater than left cerebellar hemisphere stable. No abnormal enhancement about the resection cavity. Exvacuodilatation of the fourth ventricle stable. Stable right temporoparietal extra-axial enhancing mass most consistent with meningioma. Stable punctate enhancing focus in distal left internal auditory canal may reflect a small schwannoma. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. No extraaxial collection. The intracranial flow voids are normal. The orbits are normal. Mucous retention cyst right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable postsurgical changes in the posterior fossa No evidence of abnormal enhancement or recurrence of the neoplasm in the posterior fossa. 2. Stable probable right temporoparietal meningioma. 3. Stable punctate enhancing focus in lateral left internal auditory canal since 2006 most likely representing a small schwannoma. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
