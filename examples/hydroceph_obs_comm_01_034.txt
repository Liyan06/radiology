Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

The CSF spaces are prominent in keeping with diffuse volume loss. There is slightly discrepant prominence of the ventricles compared to the sulci likely representing central volume loss however cannot completely exclude mild communicating hydrocephalus. No midline shift mass-effect or extra-axial fluid collections. No evidence of acute transcortical infarction acute intracranial hemorrhage. No areas of restricted diffusion. Bilateral nonenhancing FLAIR/T2 hyperintense areas within the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter representing sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Scattered susceptibility artifact seen tracking within the sulci bilaterally likely representing prior subarachnoid hemorrhage. No abnormal enhancement in the parenchyma or coverings of the brain. Mil asymmetry in hippocampal volume right greater than left. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as in the superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable. Mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. No abnormalities of the calvarium or overlying soft tissues. Ligament hypertrophy/osteophyte posterior to the dens is seen effacing the right paracentral thecal sac.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute abnormalities on enhanced MR brain. 2. Slightly discrepant prominence of the ventricles compared to the sulci likely representing central volume loss however cannot completely exclude mild communicating hydrocephalus. 3. Prior subarachnoid hemorrhage. 4. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
