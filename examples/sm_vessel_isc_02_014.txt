Diseases: ['schwannoma', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is extensive patchy subcortical deep and periventricular white matter T2/FLAIR signal increase grossly stable. Findings are nonspecific though in a patient this age are most commonly secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No acute cerebral ischemia is seen on diffusion weighted imaging. There are small dilated perivascular spaces in the inferior basal ganglia. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. Cerebral volume is normal for age and there is no hydrocephalus. Evaluation of the internal auditory canals and cerebello-pontine angles demonstrate a 1.5 cm transverse length intracanalicular mass on the right with more nodular component at the right cerebellopontine angle. Finding is consistent with a vestibular schwannoma that does not appear changed over the last six months. High flair signal within the cochlea and vestibule is again noted stable suggesting proteinaceous material and/or inflammation less likely mass. The visualized paranasal sinuses are again notable for persistent total opacification of the frontal sinuses and superior left ethmoid air cells. There may be proteinaceous material versus polyps within some of the frontal sinuses difficult to characterize without contrast. Sphenoid sinus and maxillary sinus mucus retention cysts/polyps have resolved since the prior exam.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable right internal auditory canal mass consistent with vestibular schwannoma. Stable fluid within the vestibule and cochlea does not completely normal with CSF inversion recovery suggesting proteinaceous material or blood. 2. Persistent diffuse opacification of frontal sinuses and portions of the left ethmoid air cells polyposis not excluded. 3. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
