Diseases: ['myelinolysis']
FINDINGS:

The cerebrum demonstrates normal gray matter and gray/white differentiation. There is a punctate focus of restricted diffusion and FLAIR signal abnormality in the left caudate head in keeping with an acute lacunar infarct. Several small foci of abnormal FLAIR signal in the periventricular and deep white matter are nonspecific often seen secondary to small vessel ischemic disease. In addition there is hyperintense T2 signal in the pons which can also be seen in small vessel ischemic disease. However the appearance of the pons hyperintense signal is somewhat prominent and another etiology such as central pontine myelinolysis should be considered. No abnormalities are seen in the midbrain and medulla. Both cerebellar hemispheres are normal in signal. No enhancing lesions are seen. There is mild cerebral volume loss. The extra axial spaces are normal without evidence of mass or blood. The vascular flow voids are unremarkable. The bony calvarium is intact. The orbits are unremarkable. Fluid is noted in the mastoids. The sinuses demonstrate no abnormalities. The visualized pharynx and parapharyngeal soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Acute punctate lacunar infarct in the left caudate head. 2. Periventricular and deep white matter hyperintense FLAIR signal often seen in the setting of small vessel ischemic disease. Hyperintense T2 signal in the pons may also be a manifestaion of small vessel ischemic disease but is somewhat prominent raising the possibility of other etiology such as central pontine myelinolysis. Correlate clinically. Findings discussed with Dr. Macarthur at 4:50 PM on 1/30/09.
