Diseases: ['meningioma', 'schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Allowing for differences in technique there is been no significant interval change when compared to February 21 2001. Redemonstrated are postsurgical changes consistent with left craniotomy and resection of the anterior left temporal lobe. There is persistent T2 and flair hyperintense signal surrounding the resection cavity and in the periventricular white matter of the left temporal lobe similar to priors. There is no associated enhancement. Redemonstrated are scattered regions of T2 and flair signal hyperintensity within the periventricular subcortical and deep white matter without associated enhancement which are in a similar distribution to prior examination. These lesions are not associated with enhancement. No flair signal alteration identified in the brainstem. There is persistent mild increased T1 signal within the left greater than right hippocampus and left parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral thalami unchanged since prior examination. Redemonstrated is a stable 7-mm enhancing extra-axial lesion adjacent to the left fifth cranial nerve with possible broadbase to the left tentorium and a small enhancing date see image number 17 of series 9 which may represent a meningioma or less likely schwannoma unchanged over multiple prior examinations. No new lesions are identified. The ventricles and basal cisterns remain patent. No evidence of acute intra-extra-axial hemorrhage or fluid collection. No acute infarct. Mild mucosal changes identified in the paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. No significant interval change compared to February 21 2011. Persistent scattered regions of supratentorial white matter flair hyperintensity as detailed above. 2. Stable 7-mm enhancing extra-axial mass lesion likely a meningioma or a schwannoma. 3. Stable left temporal postsurgical changes. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
