Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

There is a tiny focus of increased signal on diffusion images in the right occipital lobe which may represent a tiny acute infarction. Other previously seen foci of restricted diffusion seen on the prior study have resolved. There are scattered foci of increased FLAIR signal in the white matter which are probably from prior ischemic events. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is no abnormal susceptibility artifact or pathologic enhancement. The ventricles and sulci are appropriate for the patient's age. There is patent intracranial circulation including the distal left vertebral artery basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. The left vertebral artery is dominant and the right vertebral artery terminates in the right PICA an anatomic variant. There are no regions of focal stenosis or aneurysm formation. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm. There is patency of the bilateral vertebral arteries. The bilateral common carotid cervical internal carotid and external carotid arteries are patent. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis. There is tortuosity of the cervical vessels at the origins and in the mid to upper cervical portions. There is a lipoma in the posterior neck. There is a left concha bullosa. These findings were discussed with Dr. Rhaenvra on 11/12/2010.
IMPRESSION:

1. Probable tiny acute infarction in the right occipital lobe. 2. Patent intracranial circulation without stenosis. 3. No stenosis of the neck vasculature noting tortuous cervical vessels. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agree with this report.
