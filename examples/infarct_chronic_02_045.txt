Diseases: ['gliosis']
FINDINGS:

No abnormal focus of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. No acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage extra cerebral fluid collections masses mass effect shift of midline structures hydrocephalus or effacement of basal cisterns. No abnormal susceptibility on the gradient sequence. Old infarcts in the right cerebellar hemisphere right frontal white matter and possibly in the left thalamus. Focal area of gliosis in the right occipital lobe. Scattered areas of T2/flair hyperintensity in bilateral cerebral white matter are nonspecific most commonly attributed to likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemia. Cerebral volume is likely age-appropriate except for minor asymmetry of the right lateral ventricle likely within limits of anatomic variation. Visualized paranasal sinuses show evidence of mild mucosal disease. Bilateral mastoids appear unremarkable. Benign appearing approximately 6 mm diameter T1 and T2 hyperintense lesion in the in the diploic space posteriorly on image from the 22 of series 4 and series 5 faintly visible on the diffusion scan may represent small hemangioma.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute infarction acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage or obvious mass lesions within limits of this unenhanced scan. 2. Old infarcts and focal area of gliosis in the right occipital lobe findings would be consistent with reported history of prior stroke. 3. Approximately 6 mm diameter T1 and T2 hyperintense lesion in the diploic space posteriorly on image from the 22 of series 4 and series 5 has a benign appearance and may represent a small hemangioma. Comparison with prior imaging would be of value to assess interval change. Follow up as clinically indicated.
