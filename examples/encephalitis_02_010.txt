Diseases: ['lymphoma', 'lymphoma', 'encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There is marked progression and interval appearance of multiple new areas of T2 prolongation in the anterior body and genu of the corpus callosum bilateral anterior commissures left caudate head medial right frontal lobe bilateral frontal subcortical white matter right midbrain. Marked abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is seen in the bilateral hippocampi and mesial temporal lobes more prominent in the left markedly progressed since the prior study. There is restricted diffusion of most of these lesions of high signal intensity likely indicating cellular neoplasia except the body of the left hippocampus which has facilitated diffusion. After administration of contrast there are new patchy areas of enhancement in the anterior/ genu of corpus callosum hippocampi and anterior commissures. Unchanged sequela of prior brain biopsy in the right anterior temporal lobe.
IMPRESSION:

1. Marked progression and interval appearance of multiple new areas of T2 prolongation restricted diffusion and patchy enhancement in the anterior body and genu of the corpus callosum bilateral anterior commissures left caudate head medial right frontal lobe bilateral frontal subcortical white matter right midbrain suspicious for lymphoma recurrence. 2. Marked abnormal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity is seen in the bilateral hippocampi and mesial temporal lobes more prominent in the left most suspicious for lymphoma recurrence as well however in the clinical setting paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis can be considered. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
