Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

Again noted is an evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect. Intraventricular extension of the hemorrhage into the lateral ventricles and subdural space is again noted with small amount of layering hemorrhage in the occipital horns. There is peripheral rim enhancement of the hematoma. Multiple foci of signal dropout on susceptibility weighted images in the bilateral temporal parietal and occipital lobes and to a lesser extent the cerebellum and left frontal lobe are present. Minimal mucosal thickening is present in the sphenoid sinus. Remaining paranasal sinuses are clear. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation seen in the bilateral cavernous internal carotid arteries supraclinoid internal carotid arteries proximal middle cerebral arteries proximal anterior cerebral arteries proximal posterior cerebral arteries or basilar artery. Possible stenosis of left vertebral artery. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving right temporal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the subdural space and a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. 2. Multiple foci of susceptibility artifact on gradient echo images. Most likely diagnosis is amyloid angiopathy. Other possibilities in the differential diagnosis include other causes of prior hemorrhage or mineralization. 3. No evidence of vascular malformation. No abnormal enhancement; however given the presence of blood products and mass effect a small amount of enhancement may be obscured. If warranted follow-up MRI may be performed perhaps in 4-6 weeks. 4. Possible left vertebral artery stenosis.
