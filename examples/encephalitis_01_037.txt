Diseases: ['rhombencephalitis', 'encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Study is limited due to sequences obtained and degradation bymotion artifact.The cerebral ventricles cortical sulci and basal cisterns areprominent for patient's stated age consistent with mild atrophy.There is diffuse symmetric increased T2 singal in the pons withextension into the cerebellar peduncles. Intravenous contrast wasnot administered and a focal enhancing component cannot beexcluded. Differential includes rhombencephalitis (viral orbacterial) and central pontine myelinolysis if there is a recenthistory of electrolyte imabalance. Alternatively this mayrepresent an atypical presentation of progressive multifocalleukoencephalopathy. There is an area of increased T2 signal inthe posterior right parietal lobe (image 25 series 5) that isconcerning for PML. There is a focal area of high T2 signalintensity adjacent to the frontal horn of the right lateralventricle that may represent an old infarct. There are multifocalregions of increased signal intensity in the periventricular whitematter and subcortical white matter that may represent sequela ofsmall vessel ischemic disease.There is a retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. There ismucosal thickening of the bilateral maxillary sinuses and leftsphenoid sinus.Results were discussed with Dr. Zaidman at approximately 1000 on04/19/05.
IMPRESSION:

1. Limited study. Diffuse increased T2 signal in the pons.Differential includes rhombencephalitis central pontinemyelinolysis or PML in the appropriate clinical setting. Rarely HIV encephalitis itself can have a similar appearance.2. Increased signal intensity in the right parietal lobeconcerning for PML.3. Old lacunar infarct adjacent to frontal horn of right lateralventricle and sequela of small vessel ischemic disease.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
