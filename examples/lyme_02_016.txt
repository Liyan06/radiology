Diseases: ['vasculitis/vasculopathy', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Ventricles are normal in size and are symmetric. Cerebral volume is probably within normal limits for age. There is no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. There are scattered small foci of T2/flair hyperintensity in the subcortical periventricular and deep white matter which are nonspecific; the differential diagnosis is broad and includes vasculitis/vasculopathy demyelination sequela of infection such as Lyme disease prior traumatic injury and inflammatory etiologies. There are scattered foci of susceptibility within the anterior left temporal lobe peripheral posterior right frontal lobe and bilateral posterior parietal lobes likely representing small foci of microhemorrhage possibly related to prior trauma. Evaluation of the temporal lobes demonstrate symmetry in size and signal intensity of the hippocampi and parahippocampal structures. No focal volume loss is identified. Temporal horns are symmetric in size. No evidence of heterotopia. Mild mucosal thickening of the visualized paranasal sinuses. Mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonspecific scattered small foci of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity within the supratentorial white matter; possible etiologies for this finding include vasculitis/vasculopathy demyelination sequela of infection prior traumatic injury and inflammatory etiologies. 2. Scattered tiny foci of susceptibility as described above likely related to microhemorrhage possibly related to prior traumatic injury. 3. Normal appearance of the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
