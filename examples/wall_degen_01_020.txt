Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Since the prior exam there is interval development of signal abnormality in the left frontal lobe see series 4 image 20 which appears to extend to the cortex. This is associated with increasing signal on diffusion weighted sequence and normal ADC value. Following contrast administration there is patchy enhancement. Post surgical changes from right pterional craniotomy with surgical cavity in the right frontal lobe unchanged. Presence of T1 hyperintense mineralization or blood products along the surgical cavity stable. New 4 mm focus of enhancement right frontal lobe adjacent to surgical cavity supralaterally see series 8 image 27 and series 9 image 21. There is wallerian degeneration seen within the right cerebral peduncle. Extensive signal abnormality involving the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres right greater than left stable and likely reflecting treatment sequela. Fatty marrow signal throughout the calvarium possibly treatment sequela as well and stable. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection mass effect midline shift or hydrocephalus. Stable mild cerebral parenchymal volume loss. Visualized paranasal sinuses are essentially clear. Findings discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Algazy at 1:40 p.m. 12/10/2010.
IMPRESSION:

1. New 4 mm focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe anterior/superior aspect of the surgical cavity nonspecific. May reflect post-treatment changes or neoplastic progression. 2. New left frontal signal abnormality extending to the cortex with associated enhancement and decreased diffusion but normal ADC value. Findings favor a subacute infarct. However in light of the right frontal finding neoplasm cannot be excluded and short interval follow-up in 4 to 6 weeks advised. 3. Stable signal abnormalities in the cerebral white matter otherwise likely post-treatment sequela.
