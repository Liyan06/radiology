Diseases: ['hematoma', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is a crescentic T2/FLAIR hyperintense collection in the leftsubdural space measuring approximately 5 mm in thickness. This isT1 slightly hypointense although not as dark as CSF withassociated pachymeningeal enhancement. There is no evidence ofmidline shift or hydrocephalus. Findings are suspicious forchronic left subdural hematoma. Along the left anterior meninges there is a focal enhancing dural nodule noted. This may representa focal meningioma alternatively metastatic disease cannotentirely be excluded.The cerebrum demonstrates normal gray matter and gray/whitedifferentiation. There are scattered foci of subcortical andperiventricular white matter T2 hyperintensity. Findings arenonspecific however likely the sequela of small vessel ischemicdisease. The thalami and basal ganglia are unremarkable. Bothcerebellar hemispheres are normal in signal. No enhancing lesionsare seen in the brain.The vascular flow voids are unremarkable. The bony calvarium isintact. The orbits are unremarkable. There is a retention cystversus polyp versus odontogenic cyst along the inferior leftmaxillary sinus. The remainder of the visualized sinuses andmastoid air cells demonstrates no abnormalities. The visualizedpharynx and parapharyngeal soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings concerning for chronic left subdural hematoma withassociated pachymeningeal enhancement. No significant midlineshift.2. No enhancing lesions in the brain. Small vessel ischemicchanges in the brain.3. Focal enhancing dural nodule noted along the left anteriorconvexity. This may represent a small meningioma howevermetastatic disease cannot entirely be excluded.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
