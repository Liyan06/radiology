Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles cisterns and sulci are symmetric. There is no mass mass effect hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There is no acute infarction. Punctate focus of encephalomalacia is present in the right cerebellum stable. There are stable scattered foci of T2 and flair increased signal in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter nonspecific. Following contrast administration there is no abnormal enhancement. There is stable bilateral proptosis and a prominent pituitary gland. There has been bilateral cataract extraction. The paranasal sinuses are clear. Mastoid air cells are clear. Within the cervical spine there are small posterior disc bulges in the mid and lower cervical spine which indent the thecal sac but do not cause cord compression. There is heterogeneity of the C2 vertebral body which may be related to degenerative changes. There is no definite intrinsic cord signal abnormality in the motion degraded T2 images of the cervical spine. Following contrast administration there is no abnormal enhancement within the cervical spine.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable nonspecific scattered foci of T2 and flair increased signal in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter. No abnormal enhancement. There is a reported history of sarcoidosis and these findings may be secondary to this process; however other etiologies are not excluded including demyelinating inflammatory and infectious etiologies as well as vasculitis. 2. Stable bilateral proptosis and prominence of the pituitary gland. Clinical correlation with hormonal replacement therapy is suggested. 3. Mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine without cord signal abnormality or abnormal enhancement
