Diseases: ['gliosis']
FINDINGS:

No acute infarction acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage extra cerebral fluid collections masses mass effect shift of midline structures hydrocephalus or effacement of basal cisterns. Focal area of gliosis / volume loss with faint susceptibility is noted in the left more than right occipital lobes see image numbers 11-15 of series 4 and image numbers 12-14 of series 8. On image number 14 of series 3 and 4 additional areas of gliosis/ volume loss are noted in the left more than right bilateral medial/ inferior frontal lobes. Following contrast administration no pathologic parenchymal/meningeal enhancement. Susceptibility in the region of right face likely from presence of metallic fixation hardware study not tailored to assess these. Polyp/retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. The rest of the visualized paranasal sinuses and bilateral mastoids appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Focal area of gliosis / volume loss with faint susceptibility in the left more than right occipital and frontal lobes most likely sequela of prior trauma. Comparison with prior outside hospital imaging would be useful to ascertain interval stability/ evolution of these changes. Advise clinical correlation. 2. No acute intracranial findings or enhancing mass lesions.
