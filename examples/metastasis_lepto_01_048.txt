Diseases: ['schwannoma', 'metastasis']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and sulci are within range of normal for age. There is no mass effect or midline shift. There is no abnormal extra-axial fluid collection. Diffusion weighted imaging does not demonstrate an acute infarct. There is no abnormal enhancement within the brain parenchyma. No definite leptomeningeal enhancement is seen. There is a questionable tiny lesion in the right internal auditory canal with apparent enhancement. This brain MRI is not a dedicated internal auditory canal MRI examination and therefore this is a questionable finding. It is unclear whether it is a real finding or artifact or vein. If it turns out to be a real finding it may be a tiny schwannoma or in this patient with metastatic cancer a tiny metastasis. A dedicated internal auditory canal MRI can be performed for confirmation. In any case this small possible lesion is itself not the cause of the patient's symptoms. The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. There is small amount of partial opacification of the mastoid air says bilaterally left more than right and also in the right petrous air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. No MRI evidence of metastases to the brain parenchyma. No definite leptomeningeal enhancement. No hydrocephalus or mass effect. 2. Questionable tiny lesion in the right internal auditory canal with apparent enhancement. This brain MRI is not a dedicated internal auditory canal MRI examination and therefore this is a questionable finding. It is unclear whether it is a real finding artifact or vein. If it turns out to be a real finding it may be a tiny schwannoma or in this patient with metastatic cancer a tiny metastasis. A dedicated internal auditory canal MRI can be performed for confirmation. In any case this small possible lesion is itself not the cause of the patient's symptoms of confusion and vomiting..
