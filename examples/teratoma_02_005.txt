FINDINGS:

Examination is remarkable for diffuse osseous metastasis.The C2 vertebral body is markedly expanded and deformed. There istumor extension into both the prevertebral region and into epiduralspace. There is probable pathologic fracture of C2 vertebral body.Thin-section CT is recommended to evaluate this. The left vertebralartery is displaced but not encased by the tumor. It remains patent.Multiple calvarial metastasis are seen in the frontal parietal andoccipital regions. A right occipital calvarium metastasis has anepidural component.The clivus is markedly expanded by metastasis. The tumor extends intothe right cavernous sinus as well as the prepontine cistern andprobably compresses the right 6th cranial nerve.Scattered foci of signal abnormality are seen in the subcorticalwhite matter without pathologic enhancement. These findings arenonspecific. The lack of contrast enhancement argues againstparenchymal metastases.There is a 4 mm intraconal lesion in the left orbit adjacent to theleft superior oblique muscle in keeping with a orbital metastasis.A mucus retention cyst is noted in the right maxillary sinus.There is a persistent left trigeminal artery.
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive osseous metastasis as detailed above.2. Metastatic lesion at C2 level resulting in probable pathologicfracture. A thin section CT through the area is recommended forfurther evaluation.3. Bony metastasis to the clivus with extension into the rightcavernous sinus and prepontine cistern resulting in probablecompression of the right 6th cranial nerve.4. Left orbital 4 mm metastasis as described.5. Scattered white matter high signal without pathologic enhancement.Non-specific.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: BAGLEY LINDA J MD
