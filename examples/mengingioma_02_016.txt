Diseases: ['meningioma', 'lipoma']
FINDINGS:

There are a few nonspecific and nonenhancing foci of white matter signal abnormality. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic brain enhancement. On image 30 of series 9 corresponding to image 19 of series 10 there is a subcentimeter focus of enhancement along the left paramedian dura adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus that may reflect a small meningioma. Nonetheless follow-up imaging in four to six weeks is recommended to ascertain stability. There is moderate nodular mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and mild thickening on the right. There is minimal pansinus circumferential mucosal thickening. Mastoid air cells clear. The is diffuse T1/T2 hypointensity within the visualized bones which can be seen with marrow packing processes in keeping with given diagnosis AML. On image 1 of series 7 there is a mass in the superficial left parotid gland that is incompletely covered on the current examination this follows the signal characteristics of fat on T2-weighted flair and the unenhanced T1-weighted images. This may reflect a lipoma. Clinically correlate.
IMPRESSION:

1. No focal parenchymal brain abnormality. 2. Abnormal signal within the marrow of the calvarium clivus and visualized cervical spine in keeping with given diagnosis of AML. 3. Subcentimeter focus of enhancement along the left paramedian dura adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus that may reflect a small meningioma. Nonetheless follow-up imaging in four to six weeks is recommended to ascertain stability. 4. Question left parotid lipoma clinically correlate. 5. Changes of the paranasal sinuses as detailed above.
