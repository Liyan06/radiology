Diseases: ['gliosis']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstration of left frontotemporal craniotomy and encephalomalacia in the left parietal vertex and left temporal lobe consistent with given history of remote trauma. There is gliosis surrounding the malacic changes in the parietal vertex and in the left temporal lobe. There is cortical restricted diffusion in the left occipital and parietal lobes which most likely represents recent/ongoing seizure activity. In the left parieto-occipital region there is T2 hyperintensity involving the cortex and underlying white matter which does not follow an expected vascular territory. Consideration could be given to the possibility that there is cortical parieto-occipital seizure activity superimposed on underlying gliosis related to prior trauma rather than an infarct especially given the nonvascular distribution. Again seen are T2 hyperintensities in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter of both cervical hemispheres as well as in the basal ganglia and pons a pattern suggesting chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Major intracranial flow voids are identified. There is ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. No hydrocephalus. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is superficial siderosis in the left temporal and left parietal lobes related to remote trauma.
IMPRESSION:

1. Gray and white matter signal abnormality in the left parieto-occipital region which does not follow an expected vascular distribution consider seizure activity superimposed on underlying post traumatic gliosis rather than infarct. 2. Redemonstration of malacic changes in the left parietal vertex and left temporal lobe consistent with given history of remote trauma. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
