Diseases: ['toxoplasmosis', 'encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

There is no change in the interval since the prior study. Redemonstrated are multiple subcortical foci of T2 prolongation in both cerebral hemispheres unchanged from prior study. Additionally there are foci of signal dropout with associated susceptibility effects in the posteromedial thalamus and anterior thalamic/capsular region extending into the right cerebral peduncle. The right cerebral peduncle is asymmetrically diminished in size likely Wallerian degeneration. This correlates with regions of calcium deposition on prior CT scan. The above findings likely reflect sequela of treated toxoplasmosis. There is a focus of encephalomalacia with associated gliosis in the right occipital lobe reflecting old infarct versus residua of prior trauma. There is no acute infarct intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial collection mass effect or mass lesion. There is no pathologic enhancement of the brain parenchyma or its coverings. There is mild ventricular and sulcal prominence compatible with cerebral atrophy unchanged. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate expected signal void related to vascular flow. Mild mucosal thickening within the paranasal sinuses. Trace fluid in the right mastoid air cells. There is left cervical adenopathy not fully evaluated but probably unchanged from 2/20/2009.
IMPRESSION:

1. No interval change. No acute intracranial process seen. 2. Probable sequela of treated toxoplasmosis. 3. Right occipital encephalomalacia reflecting sequela of old infarct or trauma. 4. Left cervical adenopathy. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agree with this report.
