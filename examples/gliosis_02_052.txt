Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Encephalomalacic changes including T2-bright signal suggestive of gliosis redemonstrated bilateral temporoparietal regions ex vacuo dilatation right greater than left occipital horns and atria lateral ventricles are associated. No change since prior. Scattered smaller hyperintensities elsewhere in the deep white matter are also redemonstrated few in number and no substantial change. No abnormal enhancement in the brain. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. Mass redemonstrated right internal auditory canal slightly projecting into cerebellopontine angle similar size compared to prior. Minimal enhancement right cochlea redemonstrated compared the left stable appearance. Comparing to more distant study May 27 2010 patient is also relatively stable since that exam. No other abnormal enhancing foci. Overall no substantial change since prior.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right CP angle/internal auditory canal enhancing mass stable compared to prior and more distant study to May 2010 most consistent with vestibular schwannoma. 2. Right greater than left encephalomalacic changes temporoparietal regions stable.
