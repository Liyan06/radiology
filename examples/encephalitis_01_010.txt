Diseases: ['encephalitis', 'normal', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There is an abnormal configuration of the brainstem with apparent expansion of the pons. No definite signal abnormality within the pons however the middle cerebellar peduncles demonstrate faint signal abnormality. This is not associated with abnormal enhancement. There is no encasement of the basilar artery. There is mild inferior displacement of the cerebellar tonsils which are located just below the foramen magnum. Scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the subcortical and deep white matter are nonspecific. There is no restricted diffusion on DWI imaging. There is no susceptibility artifact on the gradient echo images. There is an incidental development venous anomaly in the right pons without associated cavernoma. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. Mild heterogeneity of the calvarial marrow is a nonspecific finding and may be seen in hematologic and/or marrow infiltrative disorders. This may also be seen as a normal variant.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal configuration of the brainstem with apparent expansion of the pons without definite signal abnormality within the pons. There is however faint signal abnormality in the middle cerebellar peduncles without associated enhancement. These findings are nonspecific. The differential diagnosis includes encephalitis paraneoplastic syndrome infiltrative glioma dysplasia and normal variant. Consider lumbar puncture for further evaluation. 2. Mild heterogeneity of the calvarial marrow is a nonspecific finding and may be seen in hematologic and/or marrow infiltrative disorders. This may also be seen as a normal variant. Above discussed with Dr. Hudson from the emergency department at 7 p.m. on 1/11/09.
