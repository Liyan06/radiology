Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and appear within normal limits for stated age of 51. There are a few small foci of increased intensity on long-TR images in the subcortical white matter nonspecific not unusual for age. Temporal horns are symmetric and within normal limits in volume mesial temporal lobe structures appear symmetric and within normal limits in volume. No suspicious foci of decreased intensity on aspect of the images no acute findings on diffusion images. Skull orbits and paranasal sinuses appear within normal limits. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. Tiny T2-bright focus measuring about 2-3 mm is seen in superior to the pituitary gland slightly T1-bright and T2-dark possibly pars intermedia cyst extending superiorly but incompletely characterized on this study.
IMPRESSION:

1. Few hyperintense foci on long-TR images subcortical white matter which are nonspecific but not unusual for age. No other findings in brain. 2. Small 2-3 mm structure situated superior to pituitary gland slightly T1-bright and perhaps small pars intermedia cyst but incompletely evaluated no mass-effect on the chiasm. Tiny meningioma not excluded consider follow-up with sella protocol MRI to include IV contrast in 6-12 months or as clinically indicated.
