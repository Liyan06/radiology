Diseases: ['astrocytoma']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated are regions of increased FLAIR signal within the cortex and subcortical white matter predominantly involving the frontal and parietal lobes. The appearance is stable and consistent with cortical and subcortical tubers. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain. There are stable small subependymal nodules noted along the ventricular margins most consistent with subependymal hamartomas. Again present is a punctate focus of enhancement near the left foramen of Monro stable in appearance. This corresponds to a focus of calcification on the CT of the head dated 8/14/2012 and most likely represents a subendymal giant cell astrocytoma or additional subependymal hamartoma. There are no additional foci of abnormal enhancement. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in size and position. The extraaxial spaces are normal without evidence of mass or blood. The intracranial flow voids are normal. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. There is moderate bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening increased since the prior.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of the brain multiple cortical/subcortical tubers and subependymal hamartomas redemonstrated. 2. Stable punctate focus of enhancement in the region of the left foramen of Monro subependymal hamartoma vs. giant cell astrocytoma.
