Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'aneurysm', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is abnormal FLAIR signal in the subarachnoid spaces of the right greater than left cerebrum within the sylvian fissures suprasellar cistern and along the anterior interhemispheric fissure in keeping with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Small amount of intraventricular blood layering in the atria bilaterally. There is mild prominence of the temporal horns which may indicate early hydrocephalus. There is no significant mass effect or midline shift. There is no restricted diffusion. Area of irregular outpouching in the region of the anterior communicating artery is redemonstrated (images 77-81 series 3). On GRE series 9 image 11 there is a corresponding focus of mildly decreased signal which could possibly represent old blood products in the wall of an aneurysm. However there is no definite corresponding increased T1 signal. As was previously mentioned this may still represent a smaller than 2 mm aneurysm vs ectasia of the artery. Otherwise there is patent intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. There are no regions of focal stenosis. There is no other area concerning for aneurysm. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Area of irregular outpouching in the region of the anterior communicating artery. Questionable focus of susceptibility in this region which could represent chronic hemorrhage into the wall of an aneurysm. However no definite corresponding increased T1 signal. Findings again may represent smaller than 2 mm aneurysm vs ectasia of the vessel. 2. Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage as described. 3. Mild dilatation of the temporal horns which may represent early hydrocephalus.
