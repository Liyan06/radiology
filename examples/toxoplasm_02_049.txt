Diseases: ['hematoma', 'hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Status post right temporal craniotomy with soft tissue swelling in the adjacent scalp. There is hemorrhagic material in the surgical cavity. There is also hemorrhagic material layering dependently in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles which have slightly decreased. Epidural and subdural collection over the surgical cavity containing hemorrhagic material. Given the differences in technique they are unchanged in comparison to CT scan of the head dated March 8 2012. The mass involving the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle is again identified. There is interval evolution of hemorrhagic material within the mass. There is also surrounding increased T2 and FLAIR signal representing vasogenic edema. No acute territorial infarction. No change in the degree of midline shift towards the left side. No new extra-axial collections. There is no interval change in the size and appearance of the 1.5 x 1.5 cm lesion in the right parapharyngeal space. Correlation with prior CT scans demonstrate that this had high attenuation. It has a hemosiderin rim and contains hemorrhagic material. It is mostly consistent with a hematoma. However superimposed infection cannot be ruled out. Mucosal thickening in the left greater than right maxillary sinus and the sphenoid sinus.The orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Expected post operative changes of right sided craniotomy for evacuation of hematoma. Hemorrhagic material in the surgical cavity and extra-axial collections unchanged in comparison to prior CT scan (given the differences in technique). 2. No interval change in the size and appearance of the mass involving the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle. 3. Right parapharyngeal space mass. It is favored to represents a hematoma. Superimposed infection cannot be ruled out. Follow up with serial imaging is recommended.
