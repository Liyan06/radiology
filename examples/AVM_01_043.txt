Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

No internal comparisons. There are multiple fiducial markers overlying the posterior scalp. Centered within the right medial posterior parietal lobe there is a serpiginous collection of flow-voids measuring approximately 2 0.6 x 4.0 cm in maximal transverse dimensions in keeping with the clinical history of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). There is surrounding adjacent T2 prolongation with peripheral areas of restricted diffusion that may be related to blood products versus ischemia from parasitization of blood flow. Additionally there is a thin extra-axial collection overlying the right parietal vertex that is T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense likely representing oxyhemoglobin/hyperacute blood products (sagittal T1 images 17 to 20 and axial flair images series 4 images 24 to 27). There is minimal mass-effect on the underlying cortex. There are multiple small blood vessels leading to the right parietal AVM including from the choroid plexus of the right occipital horn and right calcarine branches. Although there are multiple enlarged draining vessels the dominant venous drainage appears to extend from the medial parietal lobe entering the superior sagittal sinus at the vertex. However only a dynamic study such as conventional angiography can clinically defined venous drainage. There are no other convincing abnormal foci of increased or decreased signal intensity in the brain. No other abnormal enhancing foci. Ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and appear age-appropriate. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. Paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right parietal AVM as detailed above. Surrounding T2 prolongation and peripheral areas of restricted diffusion likely related to blood products versus ischemia from parasitization of blood flow. 2. Thin subdural hematoma overlying the right parietal vertex.
