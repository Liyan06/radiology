Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Images are mildly motion degraded limiting direct evaluation of the cerebral aqueduct. There is marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles which have nearly a colpocephalic appearance. The corpus callosum is present but thinned and may be related to mass effect from the ventricles. There is mass effect on the tectum which appears compressed anteriorly. The third ventricle is mildly dilated but not to the same degree as the lateral ventricle. The fourth ventricle and is near normal in size. No evidence of transependymal flow of CSF. The cerebellar tonsils remain above the foramen magnum. The prepontine cistern is visualized. Patient is status post bilateral ocular surgery. The sella is excavated. For the degree of motion artifact no definite abnormal signal seen within the brain parenchyma. No hemorrhage or transcortical infarction. The sella is partially empty. No abnormal enhancement in the brain or its covering. Pan sinus inflammatory changes with bilateral maxillary sinus air-fluid levels. Appropriate flow voids seen at the skull base. Phase contrast imaging shows flow within the prepontine cistern to the foramen magnum. No definite flow is seen in the cerebral aqueduct.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings compatible with obstructive hydrocephalus at the level of the cerebral aqueduct. No definite flow through the aqueduct on phase contrast images. 2. Evaluation of the brain parenchyma is limited by mass effect from the ventricles. If there are prior studies available it would be very helpful to evaluate for progression by comparing them.
