FINDINGS:

There is an intra-axial mass lesion involving the bilateral frontal lobes right greater than left with extensive associated T2 abnormality which involves both the gray and white matter. There is extension of T2 signal abnormality extending into the genu/body of the corpus callosum bilateral basal ganglia (right greater than left) bilateral caudate heads and bilateral temporal lobes. There is a second area of T2 abnormality in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Mass effect results in sulcal effacement effacement of the right lateral ventricle right to left midline shift measuring approximately 6 mm and enlargement of the left lateral ventricle. There are multi-focal areas of enhancement in the right and left frontal lobes. The distribution of the multifocal areas of enhancement appear to be subependymal and periventricular. In the regions of enhanching tissue there is no facilitative restriction. MR perfusion demonstrates focal areas of marked increased cerebral blood volume in several but not all areas of enhancement. MR spectroscopy demonstrates areas of marked elevated choline to creatinine ratio decreased NAA and lipid/lactate peaks in keeping with high grade neoplasm. The CT scan suggested a small colloid cyst. Reviewing the thin sectioned T2 weighted study I believe there is a very small colloid cyst but in light of the other findings this seems inconsequential because of its small size.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with diffuse high-grade neolasm favor lymphoma. Differential diagnosis includes gliomatosis cerebri. Because of the possibility that this could be a secondary lymphoma further evaluation with CT chest abdomen and pelvis should be considered. Dr. Lega was notified of the results. 2. Probable small colloid cyst which appears more conspicuous on the CT scan.
