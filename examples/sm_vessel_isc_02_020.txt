Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

For the brain again seen is small region of artifact anddistortion along the anterior sella and left suprasellar regionconsistent with known aneurysm clipping. There is increasedintensity on long-TR images in a portion of the head of the leftcaudate and focal encephalomalacia left frontal lobe which appearstable. There are multiple foci of increased intensity on long-TRimages in the deep and periventricular white matter which haveincreased in number and extent since the prior exam in 2000. Inaddition there is a cortically based hyperintensity in the leftoccipital lobe which is new. None of these foci enhance. Thepattern is nonspecific except for the left occipital lesion whichis suggestive of a small transcortical infarct occurring since2000.Otherwise the ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric andage-appropriate. No other changes since the prior study.Appropriate intracranial flow voids identified.Evaluation of the cervical spine reveals mild straightening whichcould be positional. There are no suspicious T1-dark foci in themarrow. Axial T2-weighted and gradient echo images are somewhatdegraded by motion but no convincing cord lesions are appreciatedwithin these limits. There are mild degenerative changesconsistent with degenerative disc disease at C4-5 C5-6 andC7-T1. However there is no evidence of cord compression at anylevel. No abnormal enhancement in cord or coverings.
IMPRESSION:

1. Probable chronic very small left occipital infarct appearingsince 2000 increasing the white matter hyperintensities. Thewhite matter pattern is nonspecific but could representprogression of chronic small vessel ischemic changes. in otherchanges artifact from aneurysm clip again noted limiting detailin proximity.2. No cord compressing lesion. Some of the imaging sequences aredegraded by motion but no convincing cord lesions appreciatedwithin these limits.
