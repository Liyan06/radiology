Diseases: ['contusion']
FINDINGS:

T1 hypersignal intensity and susceptibility artifact areseen within the anterior and inferior left temporal lobesconsistent with hemorrhagic contusion. There is mild rightanterior temporal contusion. The left frontal epidural hematomadescribed on the prior head CT is stable and demonstrates mildsurrounding edema. In addition there is small component ofhemorrhagic contusion in the left frontal lobe. There is stablediffuse subarachnoid and linear left occipetal subduralhemorrhage. No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage. There islinear hyper T2 signal intensity within the midbrain that mayrepresent diffuse axonal injury.There is mininalThere is a bilateral temporal parietal soft tissue swelling/fluidcollection .The left maxillary sinus bilateral ethmoid air cells and sphenoidsinuses and mastoids are opacified.
IMPRESSION:

1. Marked broad based disc bulge at the C6/C7 disc space . No cordcontussion ligamentous injury or epidural hematoma.2. Hemorrhagic contusion within the left anterior and inferiortemporal lobes and bifrontal lobes. Stable left frontal epiduralhematoma.3. Linear midbrain T2 hypersignal intensity that may representdiffuse axonal injury (DAI).4. Bilateral temporal parietal soft tissue swelling/fluidcollection.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
