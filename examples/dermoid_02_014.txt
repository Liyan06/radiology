Diseases: ['dermoid']
FINDINGS:

There are at least two foci of high T2/FLAIR signal abnormality inthe right medial temporal lobe and the left anterior frontallobe both of which enhance. Given the history of lung cancer metastatic disease is strongly suspected.Scattered foci of restricted diffusion in the right cerebellum left cerebellar vermis right parietal lobe and right temporallobe laterally are concerning for embolic infarcts.Ventricles and sulci are prominent likely reflecting age-relatedvolume loss. Additional scattered nonenhancing foci ofperiventricular and deep white matter signal abnormality onT2/FLAIR are nonspecific in etiology. Most likely these reflectsmall vessel ischemic disease changes.Visualized paranasal sinuses and orbits are within limits ofnormal in appearance.Likely postsurgical changes are present in the superficial tissuesof the left posterior neck.Incidentally noted is a 28 mm lesion in the left tongue or floorof mouth incompletely evaluated. It may represent a retentioncyst such as a ranula or perhaps a dermoid cyst.
IMPRESSION:

1. At least two likely metastatic lesions in the right temporallobe and left anterior frontal lobe.2. Foci of restricted diffusion concerning for embolic infarcts.3. Age related volume loss and likely changes of small vesselischemic disease.4. Incidentally noted is a 28 mm lesion in the left tongue orfloor of mouth incompletely evaluated. It may represent aretention cyst such as a ranula or perhaps a dermoid cyst.Findings discussed with Dr. Evans at 5:24 pm on 6/16/06.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStation
