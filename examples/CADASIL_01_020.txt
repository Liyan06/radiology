Diseases: ['cadasil']
FINDINGS:

There is non-specific extensive white matter disease with T2 prolongation in the subcortical periventricular pericallosal white matter and centrum semiovale. White matter T2 signal abnormality extends to the anterior temporal lobes with thinning of the corpus callosum. There is no mineral deposition in the thalamus. There is disproportionate prominence of the ventricles in relation to sulci in keeping with white matter volume loss. Cerebellum volume loss is noted. There is no abnormal enhancement or restricted diffusion. There is no evidence of abnormal iron deposition in the thalamus. There are no discrete T1 holes in the white matter. Marrow signal is preserved. Mild ethmoid sinus disease is noted. Cervical spine: Please note to evaluation of the cervical spine is degraded due to substantial motion artifact. There is no convinving evidence of high T2 cord signal which does not appear to be expanded. There is no abnormal enhancement. There straightening of the cervical spine which is otherwise normal in alignment. Marrow signal and disc height are preserved. Thoracic spine: Alignment is maintained throughout the thoracic spine. Vertebral body and disc height are preserved with preservation of marrow signal. There is no abnormal enhancement.
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive white signal abnormality extending to the temporal tip and thinning of the corpus callosum. While these findings can be seen in the setting of demyelinating disease they are nonspecific in a patient of this age and CADASIL or vascular white matter disease should be considered. 2. No definite abnormal T2 signal in the cervical/thoracic spine or abnormal enhancement.
