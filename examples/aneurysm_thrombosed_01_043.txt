Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'dermoid']
FINDINGS:

Few scattered nonenhancing foci of high FLAIR signal abnormality are seen in bilateral subcortical white matter nonspecific in appearance. An approximately 5 mm in size focus of signal abnormality is seen in the suprasellar region. This appears to have a rim of hypointense signal on 3D TOF sequence with hyperintense center. A second more tubular appearing smaller structure of similar signal intensity is seen posterior to this. These two structures may be in communication inferiorly. CT angiogram is recommended for further evaluation. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection shift of midline structures mass effect or masses. No regions of restricted diffusion. There is no abnormal contrast enhancement. Right mastoid air cells and right middle ear cavity opacification is visualized. Hypoplastic bilateral maxillary sinuses. There is patency of the intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. There are no regions of focal stenosis or definite aneurysm formation. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Patency of the intracranial circulation as above. 2. Single 5 mm in size focus of signal abnormality in the suprasellar region. Smaller tubular structure of similar signal intensity posterior to this with possible communication of these structures more inferiorly. Differential considerations of this lesion include thrombosed aneurysm. Alternatively dermoid can be considered. Correlation with CT angiogram of the circle of Willis is recommended. 3. Few scattered nonenhancing foci of high FLAIR signal abnormality in bilateral subcortical white matter nonspecific in appearance. 4. Findings discussed with Dr. McGarvey.
