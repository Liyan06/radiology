Diseases: ['hematoma', 'hygroma']
FINDINGS:

There is an intraparenchymal hematoma in the inferior right temporal lobe just over petrous ridge. The size of this finding is unchanged in comparison to CT scan dated July 25 2011. There is slight increased signal in inferior left temporal lobe on FLAIR images similar pattern with minimal susceptibility artifact here as well. On postcontrast images there is no convincing enhancement. There is a focus of increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity in left anterior frontal lobe with no enhancement and small amount of susceptibility coud be recent or chronic injury. The rest of the brain parenchyma does not demonstrate any other foci of parenchymal hemorrhage. No acute infarction. No midline shift. There are subdural collections over the left and right hemispheres with mixed intensity not following fluid on all sequences and with different intensities on right suggesting subdural hematomas of different ages. Appropriate intracranial flow voids including dural sinuses. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. There is fluid and blood products in the mastoid air cells and middle ears bilaterally. Otherwise the paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. A focus of inferior right parietal lobe hematoma. Abnormal signal in inferior left temporal lobe. Bilateral subdural collections which may represent hygroma or chronic subdural on left and acute or subacute on chronic subdural hemorrhage on right The constellation of finding is very suspicious for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up CT scan of the brain is recommended. 2. Fluid and blood products and bilateral mastoid air cells. Consider CT temporal bones at time of follow up CT brain.
