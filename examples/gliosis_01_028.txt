Diseases: ['infarction', 'infarction']
FINDINGS:

There is encephalomalacia and gliosis within the medial right frontal lobe and corpus callosum compatible with an old right ACA territory infarction. There is susceptibility in the right medial frontal lobe likely related to old hemorrhage. There is corpus callosal volume loss. There are patchy areas of restricted diffusion and T2 prolongation along the left medial frontal lobe with a small focus extending into the medial left parietal lobe consistent with an early subacute left ACA territory infarction. Additional areas on T2 prolongation within the subcortical and ventricular white matter are nonspecific but likely represent chronic ischemic changes. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial fluid collection mass effect or midline shift. There is near-complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus which may represent a large mucous retention cyst. There are trace mucosal changes in the ethmoid air cells. There is low T1-weighted signal within the calvarial bone marrow nonspecific.
IMPRESSION:

1. Old right ACA territory infarction. 2. Early subacute left ACA territory infarction. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or significant mass effect. 3. Low calvarial bone marrow signal. This is nonspecific and differential considerations include chronic anemia bone marrow infiltrative process or treatment effects. Findings discussed with Dr. Nellore at 11:30 pm on 5/12/2008. Attending note: I have reviewed the examination and agree with the above comments. The subacute left frontal infarct is continuing to evolve without mass effect or hemorrhage. One also notes encephalomalacic changes in the splenium of the corpus callosum as previously noted.
