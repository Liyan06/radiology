Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

MRI of the brain was performed utilizing the following sequences;sagittal T1-weighted axial T2-weighted axial FLAIR and axialgradient echo sequences.There are small subacute subdural hematomas over the convexitiesbilaterally right greater than left. There is no parenchymalhemorrhage or midline shift. The ventricles are normal in size andshape. The intracranial flow voids are maintained. There is minimalsoft tissue swelling involving the right forehead. In addition signal abnormality and soft tissue swelling is noted in the leftsuboccipital region involving the posterior musculature most likelyrepresenting contusion in the setting of trauma clinically correlate.There is expansion of the diploic space involving left occipital andleft parietal bones with preservation of inner and outer tables thiscan reflect normal variation or fibrous dysplasia. Correlation withCT is recommended.
IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral small subacute subdural hematomas over the cerebralconvexities right greater the left. Follow-up imaging is recommendedto insure stability.2. Soft tissue changes involving the left suboccipital cervicalmusculature most likely related to recent trauma and hematoma. CT ismore sensitive in assessing for fractures.3. Minimal soft tissue swelling over the right forehead.4. Expansion of the diploic space involving occipital bone as above.Dr. Eberly was notified of the findings at the time of interpretation.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: LOEVNER LAURIE A MD
