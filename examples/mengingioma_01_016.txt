Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated are postsurgical changes status post right frontal craniotomy. There is stable T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the anterior right temporal lobe likely postsurgical in nature. There is continued enhancement and dural thickening anterior to Meckel's cave on the right and along the lateral dural margin of the right cavernous sinus. Once again there is no appreciable interval change in this area when compared to multiple prior examinations again noting that enhancement and thickening was present in this area on the preoperative examination. The findings likely represent postoperative reactive changes however meningeal neoplasm is not completely excluded. There are no extra-axial fluid collections or mass effect. There is no evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. Scattered foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity are stable and nonspecific likely the sequela of chronic ischemia. Once again seen is absence of flow void in the petrous and cavernous portions of the right internal carotid artery. There is normal flow void in the right ACA and MCA vessels. Flow voids are otherwise maintained on the left. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post right frontal craniotomy and resection of meningioma; stable postsurgical changes in the anterior right temporal lobe. 2. Persistent mild enhancement and dural thickening anterior to Meckel's cave on the right stable compared to multiple prior exams and likely reflecting reactive changes. A small meningeal neoplasm is not completely excluded. 3. Stable occlusion of the right internal carotid artery in the petrous and cavernous portions with distal reconstitution in the MCA and ACA. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
