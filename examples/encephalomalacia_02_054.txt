Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Moderate diffuse cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. Extensive cerebral white matter confluent areas of T2/flair hyperintensity most consistent with sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease. Old bilateral frontal lobe corona radiata and basal ganglial lacunar infarctions. Small area of encephalomalacia with associated hemosiderin staining in lateral right occipital lobe also likely sequelae of chronic ischemia. Area of abnormal magnetic susceptibility in posterlateral left thalamus extending into left periventricular white matter consistent with area of old hemorrhage. Smaller foci of magnetic susceptibility in medial right occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres most consistent with microhemorrhages. No acute intracranial hemorrhage mass effect midline shift or extra-axial collection or abnormal diffusion signal to suggest acute to subacute ischemia. Mucosal disease involving ethmoid air cells and frontoethmoidal recesses.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute to subacute ischemia. 2. Moderate diffuse volume loss sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease and old lacunar infarctions. Small area of right occipital encephalomalacia with hemosiderin staining also likely sequelae of chronic ischemia. 3. Old hemorrhage posterlateral left thalamus extending into periventricular white matter. Likely microhemorrhages in medial right occipital lobe and cerebellar hemispheres as above. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST ADDITION: I agree with the preliminary report with the following additions: Lesion in soft tissues of left cheek measures approximately 1 cm for which close correlation is advised. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
