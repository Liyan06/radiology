Diseases: ['meningioma', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Again seen are post-surgical changes related to a bifrontal craniotomy and left frontal lobe meningioma resection. Again seen is a surgical cavity/encephalomalacia in the superior left frontal lobe. There continues to be white matter changes adjacent to the surgical site demonstrated by increased T2 signal grossly stable on the left. Compared to the prior study there has been mild progression of increased T2 signal in the centrum semi ovale and periventricular white matter bilaterally. These areas do not demonstrate restricted diffusion. There is no pathologic enhancement following contrast administration. There is 5 mm flow void signal projecting anterolaterally from the right paraclinoid internal carotid artery. This may represent a pneumatized clinoid process although aneurysm is not excluded. Further evaluation with head MRA could evaluate. Also comparison to prior CT if available would be helpful. There is no acute intracranial hemorrage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift acute transcortical infarct or mass effect. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post left frontal meningioma resection with no evidence of enhancing residual or recurrent tumor. 2. Mild interval progression of T2 signal in the bilateral centrum semi ovale and periventricular white matter without restricted diffusion or enhancement. This may be post-treatment changes or be related to progression of chronic ischemic white matter changes. 3. 5 mm flow void signal projecting anterolaterally from the right paraclinoid internal carotid artery. This may represent a pneumatized clinoid process although aneurysm is not excluded. Further evaluation with head MRA could evaluate. Also comparison to prior CT if available would be helpful.
