Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

In comparison to MRI dated July 10 2011 there has been interval development of several punctate foci of restricted diffusion involving bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and right frontal and parietal lobes in keeping with small foci of infarction. This pattern is very suspicious for an embolic phenomenon. There is also interval increase in T2 and FLAIR signal intensity in periventricular and deep white matter and splenium and genu of the corpus callosum with no restricted diffusion mild fullness in genu and splenium. Some of the signal abnormalities show facilitated diffusion others are equivocal with diffusion coefficient similar to normal appearing brain. These areas of abnormal signal do not demonstrate enhancement. The gradient echo images do not demonstrate suspicious foci of blooming artifact. There is minimal enhancement along the tract of the Ommaya catheter decreasing signal abnormality around catheter on long-TR images since prior. Otherwise there is no enhancement in areas of new abnormal signal intensity in periventricular deep white matter or corpus callosum or surrounding the areas of punctate infarction. The study is otherwise unchanged. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. There is a mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. Otherwise the paranasal sinuses are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval development of multiple very small punctate foci of infarction involving the cerebellum and right cerebral hemisphere. This pattern is suspicious for an embolic phenomenon but extent is relatively mild. 2. Interval development of abnormal signal in the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum and deep white matter. Given that these findings have developed over the past 3 weeks chemotherapy related encephalopathy is a consideration.
