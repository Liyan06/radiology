Diseases: ['contusion', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

Ventricle and sulci are normal size for patient's age. There are subtle gyriform FLAIR signal abnormality along the left frontal and right occipital lobes which corresponds to areas of high attenuation on prior CT and may be related to a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A focus of T2 prolongation in the right frontal lobe subcortical white matter near the vertex corresponds to another area of high attenuation on CT and may represent a tiny focus of parenchymal hemorrhage/contusion. These are not well seen on the GRE sequences. No mass effect midline shift or hydrocephalus. No restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. No pathologic intraparenchymal or meningeal enhancement. Basal cisterns are open. Expected flow voids of the major intracranial vessels are patent. Orbits mastoids and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Subtle gyriform FLAIR signal abnormality along the left frontal and right occipital lobes which corresponds to areas of high attenuation on prior CT likely represent a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage and may be post-traumatic. No hydrocephalus mass effect or midline shift. 2. Focus of T2 prolongation in the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe corresponding to a focus of high attenuation on prior CT likely a focus of parenchymal hemorrhage possibly a contusion from recent trauma. 3. No pathologic intraparenchymal or meningeal enhancement. Findings discussed with Dr. Flesch at 108 hrs 8/11/2009. Attending Note: I have reviewed the exam and agree with the above comments however I L. not convinced of the abnormal flair signal noted above. The appearance of these regions could be normal variant or technical effects.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
