Diseases: ['encephalitis', 'infarction', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

The study is slightly degraded by motion. A focal area of increased T2 signal is seen within the medial right temporal lobe but not as well appreciated on the FLAIR sequences. This area also demonstrates enhancement on the postcontrast images. Focal area of encephalomalacia and gliosis in the right frontal lobe is compatible with an old infarction. A few additional foci of T2 prolongation are scattered in the periventricular and subcortical white matter nonspecific but likely sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease. No dominant mass midline shift or hydrocephalus. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or extracerebral fluid collection. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. No abnormal areas of restricted diffusion. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. Orbits unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. T2 hyperintensity and enhancement in the medial right temporal lobe which would be compatible with the suspected diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. 2. Findings compatible with old infarction in the right frontal lobe as well as sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease. Findings were discussed with Dr. Bailey on 9/5/2008 at 10:55 p.m. FINAL ATTENDING INTERPRETATION: Agree with the preliminary report. There is enhancement within the medial right temporal lobe as stated above. Posteriorly this likely reflects normal enhancing choroid plexus. However there is an asymmetric area of enhancement anteriorly within the region of the hippocampus/amygdala. There is no associated T2 prolongation which would be expected with herpes or limbic encephalitis or metastatic disease. The clinical significance and etiology of these findings are uncertain. Close interval follow-up imaging is recommended to ensure stability or resolution.
