FINDINGS:

There is redemonstration of the large right frontoparietal hematoma with associated vasogenic edema and mass effect on the occipital horn the right lateral ventricle. There has been interval change of its internal signal characteristics with decreased susceptibility and increased restricted diffusion. Although this may be related to blood products superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. Additionally there is increased restricted diffusion along the medial right parietal and occipital lobes that may be related to cytotoxic edema possibly from embolization. There is also increased restricted diffusion along the periphery of the hematoma that may be related to cytotoxic edema. There is also a new focus of restricted diffusion within the right cerebellar vermis. There is continued evolution of the subacute left thalamic infarct. Mild right greater left cerebral hemisphere flair sulcal hyperintensity has decreased possibly related to subarachnoid hemorrhage leptomeningeal process or hyperoxygenation. There is stable gliosis in the left frontal lobe. Scattered T2 hyperintensities within the bilateral white matter may be related to chronic small vessel ischemia. The ventricles are stable in size. Small amount of layering intraventricular hemorrhage is noted. The paranasal sinuses are clear. There is fluid signal in bilateral mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Redemonstration of the large right frontoparietal hematoma with interval change in its signal characteristics with decreased susceptibility and increased restricted diffusion. This may be related to blood products but superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. 2. Increased restricted diffusion along the medial right parietal and occipital lobes as well as the posterior rim of the hematoma that may be related to cytotoxic edema. 3. New punctate focus of acute infarction within the right cerebellar vermis.
