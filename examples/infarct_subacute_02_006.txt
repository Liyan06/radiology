Diseases: ['normal', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Images are severely degraded by motion rendering some sequences nondiagnostic. The ventricles are prominent out of proportion to sulci. There are extensive periventricular T2 hyperintensities predominantly in the occipital horn. There is T2 signal flow void seen in the cerebral aqueduct. Findings are suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Correlate clinically. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain to suggest acute infarction. There are foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the white matter which are likely sequelae of chronic ischemia. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. No extraaxial fluid collection. No mass lesions. No intracranial hemorrhage. The intracranial flow voids are normal. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. The paranasal sinuses are normal..
IMPRESSION:

1. Markedly degraded images secondary to motion. Recommend optimizing sedation before attempting repeat MR examination. 2. Ventriculomegaly out of proportion to sulci with periventricular T2 hyperintensity suggestive of transependymal CSF flow. Flow void seen in the cerebral aqueduct. These findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Correlate clinically. 3. No acute infarction or hemorrhage. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the preliminary report without modification. Increased T2 signal in periventricular white matter is likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation and agree with the findings in this report.
