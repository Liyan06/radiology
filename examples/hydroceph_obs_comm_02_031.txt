Diseases: ['hydrocephalus', 'meningitis']
FINDINGS:

There has been interval evolution of post surgical changes status post right frontal craniotomy and GBM resection with decrease in size of the postoperative collection in the surgical bed and near resolution of extra-axial fluid and gas. There is persistent abnormal FLAIR/T2 signal around the surgical cavity in the right frontal lobe lobe extending into the subcortical white matter more so than on the prior examination. There is also extension into the corpus callosum. This may be in manifestation of radiation therapy or progressive tumor. There is extensive nodular around the surgical cavity which is increased along its medial aspect in keeping with disease progression. The ventricular size is slightly increased from prior examination. While this may be secondary to decreased mass effect from resolving post-surgical change communicating hydrocephalus is also possible. There is mild mass effect upon the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle similar to prior examination. Minimal leftward midline shift is improved from prior examination. There are no areas of restricted diffusion. Flow voids are maintained.
IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of nodular enhancement along the superomedial aspect of the resection cavity in keeping with progression of residual tumor. Increased abnormal FLAIR/T2 signal in the right frontal lobe may reflect tumor progression or radiation change. 2. Increased ventricular size as compared to prior study which may be due to diminished mass effect related to improved post surgical change but consider communicating hydrocephalus which could reflect early carcinomatous meningitis and close interval follow up is advised.
