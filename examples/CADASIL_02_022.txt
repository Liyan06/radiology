Diseases: ['sarcoidosis', 'lymphoma', 'cadasil']
FINDINGS:

There are areas of T2 prolongation within the white matter and subarachnoid spaces in the left fronto-parietal region and right parietal lobe; much more extensive on the left. There is associated smooth perivascular and leptomeningeal enhancement with possible vascular prominence as well. Mild leptomeningeal enhancement is also seen in bilateral inferior medial frontal lobes and right cerebellum. There is also appears to be enhancement around the right cavernous internal carotid artery with extension to the right superior orbital fissure (series 1001 image 9). No restricted diffusion. No abnormal susceptibility artifact on gradient echo images. Few other scattered foci of white matter T2 prolongation are seen nonspecific and may reflect small vessel ischemic disease. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. The orbital contents are grossly unremarkable. The mastoid air cells and visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Areas of white matter and subarchnoid space T2 prolongation in the left greater than right cerebral hemispheres with associated smooth perivascular and leptomeningeal enhancement. Leptomeningeal enhancement is also seen in bilateral inferior medial frontal lobes and right cerebellum and enhancement is also seen around the right cavernous internal carotid artery with extension to the right superior orbital fissure. Differential considerations include an infectious/inflammatory process including vasculitis sarcoidosis TB viral infection. Other less likely considerations include intravascular lymphoma CADASIL. Further evaluation with conventional angiogram may be helpful. Results were discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Gluckman at 12:10 pm on 5/7/09.
