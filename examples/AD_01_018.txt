Diseases: ['encephalomalacia', 'gliosis']
FINDINGS:

Generalized parenchymal volume loss noted with prominence of the ventricles and sulci. There is evidence of more focal volume loss involving the medial temporal bilaterally manifested by widening of the ambient cisterns. Additionally the mammillary bodies appear somewhat diminutive in caliber. No mass effect or midline shift. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or extracerebral fluid collections. Moderate scattered foci of T2 prolongation are seen primarily in the periventricular and deep white matter with a few foci in the subcortical white matter as well. Old lacunar infarct noted in the left thalamus. A cystic area with surrounding T2 prolongation is noted within the left occipital lobe with associated volume loss compatible with cystic encephalomalacia and surrounding gliosis. No diffusion abnormalities. Mucosal thickening noted in the right maxillary sinus but the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise clear. Orbits unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Parenchymal volume loss which is likely age-related. There are findings of volume loss involving the medial temporal lobes and mammillary bodies which can be seen in the setting of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Recommend clinical correlation. 2. Signal abnormality in the periventricular and deep white matter nonspecific but likely related to chronic small vessel ischemia. 3. Cystic encephalomalacia with surrounding gliosis in the left occipital lobe likely related to a remote infarct. Old lacunar infarct in the left thalamus.
