FINDINGS:

Abnormal contrast enhancement involves chiasm a portion of right optic tract and both pre-chiasmatic optic nerves. The optic chiasm is enlarged on right greater than left. There is enhancement along gyrus rectus on right greater than left primarily leptomeningeal pattern involving also olfactory bulbs. There is T2-bright signal intensity along the optic tracts bilaterally and along anterior right frontal lobe consistent with edema associated with enhancement. There are scattered hyperintensities in periventricular and deep as well as subcortical white matter mild in extent nonspecific pattern. There is nodular enhancement with T2-dark signal intensity in the anterior right nasal cavity and septum which enhances. There is a small dot of enhancement in the anterior pons confirmed on two views uncertain if related to primary process or whether this could represent a small telangiectasia. Chronic inflammatory changes noted right maxillary sinus with peripheral enhancement.
IMPRESSION:

1. Markedly abnormal optic chiasm pre-chiasmatic optic nerves and optic tracts on right more than left. There is also enhancement along right greater than left gyrus rectus and along olfactory bulbs. Given history of sarcoid this is the most likely explanation. Without this history other infectious/inflammatory etiologies could be considered (including tuberculosis) or even neoplastic (for example lymphoma or carcinomatous meningitis). Follow up recommended.2. Intranasal/septal enhancing mass could also be related to sarcoid. Correlate with direct visualization.3. Small focus enhancement in pons pathologic vs. telangiectasia.
