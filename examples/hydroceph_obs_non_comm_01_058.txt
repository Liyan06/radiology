Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated is a large cystic and solid mass which expands the sella and extends superiorly. The suprasellar component may be slightly decreased measuring 3.9 X 2.9 x 2.9 (AP x TR x CC) previously 4.3 x 2.8 x 3.4 cm. There are new blood products within the suprasellar component. Stable mass effect upon the suprasellar components including the optic chiasm anterior cerebral vessels and hypothalamus/third ventricle. Evolution of postsurgical changes within the sellar component. There is evidence of invasion of the right cavernous sinus with tissue extending lateral to the cavernous carotid seen on image 15/series 9. Carotid flow voids are preserved. Stable component extending lateral to the right optic nerve near the optic canal. Postsurgical changes from transsphenoid approach again demonstrated; previously seen nonenhancing material along the left nasal septum no longer present possibly blood products or packing material. Continued enlargement of the lateral ventricles likely hydrocephalus secondary to obstruction at the level of the third ventricle by the suprasellar mass. Stable mild transependymal flow of CSF. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain parenchyma. There is no abnormal enhancement in the brain. The orbits are normal. Polypoid mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses. Inspissated secretions within the sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving postsurgical changes from transsphenoid partial resection of sellar-suprasellar mass. Possible invasion into the right cavernous sinus. 2. Slight decrease in size of suprasellar component with increased internal blood products. Stable mass effect on suprasellar structures including mild obstructive hydrocephalus from compression of the anterior third ventricle. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
