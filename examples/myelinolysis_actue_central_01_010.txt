Diseases: ['myelinolysis', 'rhombencephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Since prior examination there is further evolution of previously seen bilateral hemispheric watershed infarct involving bilateral frontal parietal lobes greater on the right and bilateral occipital lobes. Also infarct in the right cerebellar hemisphere is unchanged. Otherwise there is no evidence of acute new territory infarct. However now there is diffuse increased T2 signal intensity of the central pons best seen on series 5 image 10-12 without facilitated nor restricted diffusion expansion/mass effect or extension superiorly to cerebral peduncles/centrum semi ovale. The appearance is nonspecific which may reflect residual wallerian degeneration. However clinical correlation for central pontine myelinolysis rhombencephalitis is recommended. Bilateral vertebral artery and basilar artery as well as central anterior circulation demonstrate normal flow void. Ventricles and sulci are stable. Trace opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells improved on the right. Minimal laminar necrosis.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval evidence of nonspecific T2 hyperintensity involving the pons as the detailed above. With the provided clinical information central pontine myelinolysis possible spectrum of wallerian degeneration are considerations and less likely rhombencephalitis . 2. Evolving bilateral cerebral hemispheric watershed infarct without new territory infarct. Findings were communicated with and acknowledged by Dr. Goren at 215-312-0046 at 5:45 p.m. on January 17 2010.
