Diseases: ['craniopharyngioma', 'dermoid', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There is a stable midline suprasellar mass measuring 12 x 10 x 12 mm with central T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypointensity. This has a rim of tissue with signal similar to gray matter with minimal foci of enhancement. There is stable mass effect on the optic chiasm and no definite involvement of the cavernous sinuses. Again the differential diagnosis includes craniopharyngioma and Rathke's cleft cyst although findings are not typical for either. An atypical dermoid cyst is also a consideration. Note that a normal posterior pituitary is not seen on this or prior studies. There are signal abnormalities related to old and evolving infarcts in the right precentral gyrus left caudate head bilateral thalami and right occipital lobe. Also redemonstrated are numerous foci of periventricular deep and subcortical white matter T2 prolongation nonspecific but likely sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. There is no restricted diffusion. There is no abnormal enhancement. The ventricles and sulci are stable in size. The extra axial spaces are normal without evidence of mass or blood. The vascular flow voids are unremarkable. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses right greater than left.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable suprasellar mass which again may represent a craniopharyngioma or Rathke's cleft cyst though imaging findings are not typical for either. An atypical dermoid cyst is also a consideration. Note that a normal posterior pituitary is not seen on this or prior studies. Correlation for diabetes insipidus or other endocrine abnormality is recommended. Continued followup is recommended. 2. Multiple evolving old infarcts as described. No acute infarct. 3. Extensive sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
