Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Images are markedly degraded by motion. There is moderate cortical atrophy more than expected for patient age and may be related to patient's underlying HIV. There are prominence of the sulci and the ventricular system. There is a cavum septum pellucidum normal variant of the ventricular system. There is marked signal abnormality in the pons and midbrain. There is periventricular and subcortical scattered foci of hyperintensity on T2/flair images. This pattern is more central in distribution with sparing of the subcortical u fibers. This is more than expected for age and atypical for simple small vessel ischemic change. No associated enhancement or restricted diffusion. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. No pathologic enhancement (parenchymal or leptomeningeal). Subtle restricted diffusion along the corticospinal tracts bilaterally or unknown etiology. The orbital contents are grossly unremarkable. Probable mucous retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. Mild scattered opacification of the ethmoid air cells. Mild opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells. Moderate nasal septal deviation from right to left. The sphenoid sinuses and frontal sinuses are essentially clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate cortical and cerebellar volume loss which may be related the patient's underlying HIV disease. 2. Moderate nonspecific brainstem periventricular and subcortical white matter signal abnormality of unknown etiology. Given the history these findings may be related to HIV encephalitis. 3. No acute infarction or pathologic enhancement.
