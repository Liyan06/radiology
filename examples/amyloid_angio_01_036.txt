Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

There are acute infarctions of the right periventicular white matter extending to the right external capsule and also a smaller infarct of the white matter near the splenium of the corpus callosum on the right. There is no susceptibility artifact concerning for hemorrhage; there is a small stable focus of susceptibility artifact in the left medial parietal lobe and left temporo-occipital region which are stable likely amyloid angiopathy or cavernomas. There are a few chronic lacunar infarctions of the white matter which are stable. There is periventricular and scattere subcortical T2 hyperintensity likely sequelae of chronic ischemia; these findings have progressed since prior. The ventricles are normal in size for patient age; ventricular and sulcal enlargement has progressed since the prior study. The extra axial spaces are without evidence of mass or blood. There are postsurgical changes from prior functional endoscopic sinonasal surgery bilaterally. These findings were discussed with and acknowledged by Dr Karen Chachu the clinician caring for the patient at 7:30 pm on 2/23/2011.
IMPRESSION:

1. Acute infarctions of the right periventricular white matter and adjacent to the right corpus callosum splenium. 2. Stable foci of susceptibility artifact on the left likely amyloid angiopathy or small cavernomas. *ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST CHANGE: I partially agree with the preliminary report with the following modifications or additions: Hemosiderin deposition in the left temporal-occipital region could be due to hypertension. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
