Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There are however small foci of hemosiderin deposition in the left parietal lobe right occipital lobe and right cerebellum. There has been mild progression of foci of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical and deep white matter. These are nonspecific however likely represent sequela of chronic microvascular change. There is a small chronic infarct in the left cerebellum. There is no abnormal diffusion restriction to suggest acute ischemia. There has been interval progression of parenchymal volume loss. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. Mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses is seen. There has been progression of mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus which is nearly completely opacified. Secretions are T2 hypointense suggesting inspissated secretions versus fungal disease. The left osteomeatal unit appears occluded.To the extent that they may be evaluated with routine MR imaging the vascular structures are normal in appearence.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute infarction. 2. Progression of volume loss.3. Probable worsened sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. 4. Small chronic infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere. 5. Small foci of susceptibility in the left parietal lobe right occipital lobe and right cerebellum. Differential includes amyloid angiopathy prior trauma or sequela of microvascular ischemic disease. 6. Progression of mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus which is nearly completely opacified. T2 hyperintensity suggests inspissated secretions versus fungal disease. Clinically correlate.
