Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluidcollection mass effect or shift of midline. The ventricularsystem is normal in size and position. Diffusion weighted imagesare normal. There is a small focus of high signal adjacent to thesplenium of the corpus callosum on the right side seen on thesagittal T1 weighted images and FLAIR images (image 15 series18) this is of questionable clinical significance.The 2D time of flight neck MRA is limited due to motion. Normalantegrade flow related enhancement is noted in the neckvasculature. Both the vertebrals and carotid arteries in the neckare normal in course and caliber. There is no evidence ofhemodynamically significant stenosis.
IMPRESSION:

1. Limited study due to motion. No acute brain abnormalitydetected.2. 3-D contrast enhanced neck MRA is not of diagnostic quality normal antegrade flow related enhancement is noted in the cervicalarteries as stated above. there is no evidence of hemodynamicallysignificant stenosis or flow limiting dissection.Results discussed with Dr. Mistretta at 8:15 PM on January 3rd 2005.
