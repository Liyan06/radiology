Diseases: ['infarction', 'normal']
FINDINGS:

There has been expected interval evolution of foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal lobes left frontal lobe as well as right cerebellar hemisphere. The focus of restricted diffusion diffusion in the left temporal lobe described on prior study is not conspicuous. No new foci of acute infarction. No intracranial hemorrhage. No abnormal foci of susceptibility in the brain parenchyma the gradient echo images. Increased signal along the sulci on FLAIR images unchanged in comparison to prior study. Please note that the FLAIR images are motion degraded. No masses midline shift or extra-axial collection. Please note that there is image degradation secondary to motion on MR angiogram particularly at the level of circle of Willis. There is patent intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. There are no regions of focal stenosis. There is no intracranial aneurysm . Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval evolution of bilateral foci of infarction the distribution of which is suggestive for an embolic phenomenon. No hemorrhagic transformation. 2. Motion degraded MR angiogram. Given this limitation it is within normal limits. 3. Abnormal FLAIR signal intensity within the sulci possibly related to high FIO2. Consider CSF sampling as clinically indicated. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
