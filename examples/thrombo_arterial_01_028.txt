Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

MRI/MRA Brain: There are multiple foci of acute ischemiainvolving the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres as well as thebrainstem/pons. Additionally there is acute ischemia in the leftPCA territory as well. This is associated with hyperintensity onT2 weighted and flair images. T2 images show no flow in thebasilar artery or right vertebral artery. This is confirmed ontime of flight MRA with no flow related enhancement within thebasilar artery right vertebral artery and distal left vertebralartery. No flow related enhancement is seen in left posteriorcerebral artery. Gradient echo images show what appears to besiderosis mostly in the posterior fossa. No fluid levels are seenthe paranasal sinuses although there is opacification rightmastoid air cells.MRI C-spine: No abnormal signal disease seen in the spinal cordparenchyma. No definite prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seenand high signal likely represents fluid in the pharynx. There isquestion of minimal high signal intensity between the occiput andposterior arch of C1 which may represent edema within theligamentous complex. Gradient echo images are significantlydegraded due to motion. Axial T2 images show flow void in theleft vertebral artery however no definite flow void the rightvertebral artery is seen.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple infarcts and posterior circulation.There appears to be thrombosis of right vertebral artery distalleft vertebral artery and basilar artery.2. Siderosis of the posterior fossa. Differential diagnosisincludes prior hemorrhage as well as other etiologies such asdural fistula.3. No abnormal signal within the spinal cord parenchyma. Thereis suggestion of edema in the ligamentous complex between theocciput and posterior arch of C1.Findings discussed with Dr. Wilden at 430pm 5-22-06.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStation
