Diseases: ['metastasis']
FINDINGS:

Right frontal approach intraventricular catheter tip left lateral ventricle unchanged in position. FLAIR hyperintensity surrounds the catheter tract stabilized with prior CT. no abnormal parenchymal enhancement. There is no restricted diffusion in the brain. No mass lesions. There is no abnormal enhancement except for equivocal enhancement in the internal auditory canals bilaterally. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. A thin right subdural collection is seen decreased in size relative to prior CT. The intracranial flow voids are normal. T2-hypointense focus in the paramedian portion of the occipital bone correlating with a sclerotic focus seen on the CT of 29 November 2011. Burr hole associated with ventricular catheter noted otherwise the calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. The paranasal sinuses are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right frontal approach ventricular catheter with surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity along the catheter tract possibly related to placement cannot exclude malfunction. No abnormal enhancement along this tract to suggest infection or neoplasm. Advise continued follow-up of this finding. 2. Thin subdural collection right frontal convexity decreased in size. 3. No evidence of metastasis; equivocal enhancement in the internal auditory canals is unchanged as the previous MR examination of 03 July 2012. Advise continued follow-up to ensure stability. 4. Sable slerotic focus in the left occipital bone just to the left of midline without definite enhancement. This finding may represent a bone island rather than metastasis. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
