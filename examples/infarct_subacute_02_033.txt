Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

Please note that the contrast MRA of the neck is technically limited.Brain:There is a 1-cm focus of abnormal signal exhibiting restricted diffusion in the left corona radiata in keeping with acute/subacute infarct.There are several additional foci in the bilateral periventricular and deep white matter representing chronic lacunar infarcts.There is volume loss for age. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are otherwise symmetric and patent. No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect. Pituitary fossa posterior fossa and both orbits are unremarkable. No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain or its covering. Small retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.MRA head:There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation seen in the bilateral cavernous internal carotid arteries supraclinoid internal carotid arteries proximal middle cerebral arteries proximal anterior cerebral arteries proximal posterior cerebral arteries basilar artery or distal vertebral arteries.MRA neck:There is no significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation seen in the bilateral common carotid arteries. There is mild less than 50% narrowing of the proximal right ICA likely on the basis of atherosclerosis. There is no significant stenosis of the left cervical internal carotid artery and bilateral proximal external carotid arteries. The cervical vertebral arteries are patent bilaterally without evidence of significant stenosis. The right vertebral artery is dominant. The left vertebral artery appears to end as PICA.Note is made of a prominent disc bulge at C5-6.
IMPRESSION:

1. Focus of acute/subacute infarction in the left coronal radiata.2. Additional chronic lacunar infarcts in the white matter.3. No hemodynamically significant stenoses or aneurysmal dilatations in the intracranial arterial vasculature.4. Less than 50% stenosis of the proximal right ICA. Otherwise no significant stenoses in the bilateral cervical carotid or vertebral arteries .
