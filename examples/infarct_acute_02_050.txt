Diseases: ['infarction', 'infarction']
FINDINGS:

There is an elongated area of restricted diffusion involving anterior left parietal lobe with extension into the adjacent deep white matter measuring 1.4 x 3.4 cm with mild edema. There is questionable faint linear enhancement anterior to this area (image 22 series 8). Additional foci of restricted diffusion are noted in the superior posterior left parietal lobe (image 90 series 5) as well as in the left frontal lobe (image 89 series 5). There is no other areas of parenchymal enhancement. There is no midline shift. No extra-axial collection. There is evidence of remote infarction involving the left superior parietal lobule (series 4 image 23). There is a small area of encephalomalacia in the right parieto-occipital area again most likely due to remote infarction. There is no acute transcortical infarct. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. There is no intracranial hemorrhage. Mild focal diffuse marrow signal loss lower C2 and visualized C3 vertebral body. The orbits are normal. The paranasal sinuses are normal. Mild mucosal thickening in the right mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Area of subacute infarction in the left parietal lobe as detailed above with questionable faint enhancement anteriorly. Additional foci of the punctate subacute infarction in the left parietal and frontal lobes. The findings are most likely secondary to septic emboli given the patient's history. 2. Bone marrow abnormal signal intensity in lower C2 and C3 as described above. Differential diagnosis includes anemia or infiltrative disorders. Clinically correlate.
