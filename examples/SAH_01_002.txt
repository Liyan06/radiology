Diseases: ['hematoma', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is expected evolution of the subdural hematoma over the right frontal and parietal convexity. It has slightly increased in size over the frontal convexity currently measuring 11 mm in thickness. There is minimal mass effect on the anterior falx unchanged in comparison to prior study. However there is progression of sulcal effacement in the right frontal and parietal lobes. There has been slight interval increase in the mild leftward midline shift now measuring 5-mm. There is related to dural enhancement over the right cerebral hemisphere. On FLAIR images there is increased signal along the sulci in the right cerebral hemisphere and to a lesser extent in the anterior left cerebral hemisphere mostly representing small amount subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is soft tissue swelling in the scalp over the right frontal bone There is a 10 x 7 mm meningioma abutting the posterior aspect of the petrous bone and the tentorium on the right side in the posterior fossa. It does not abut the transverse or sigmoid sinuses. There are foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the white matter likely sequelae of chronic ischemia. No acute infarction or masses. No abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma. There is mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses and complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus. There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Expected evolution of the right convexity subdural hematoma slightly increased over right frontal lobe with increased mass effect and sulci effacement in the right frontal and parietal lobes. Slight increase in mild leftward midline shift. Associated right-sided dural enhancement. Small subarachnoid hemorrhage over the frontal and parietal convexity on the right side and to a lesser extent on the left side. Continued follow-up is recommended. 2. Stable right posterior fossa meningioma.
