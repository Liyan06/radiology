Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple scattered punctate foci of restricted diffusion and corresponding low signal on ADC maps in the pons and throughout the cerebral hemispheres ranging between 10-20. There is no associated enhancement. These likely represent septic emboli given the history of endocarditis. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is mild cortical and cerebellar volume loss which is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Punctate areas of hyperdensity on CT are hypointense on T2 images consistent with mineralization or calcification. No associated enhancement. There are subcortical and periventricular white matter T2/flair hyperintensity nonspecific but likely sequela of small vessel ischemic change. There is a small meningioma along the right falx that measures 7 mm in greatest diameter see postcontrast axial T1 weighted images series 16 and image 16 and coronal images series 17 image 18. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. The orbital contents are grossly unremarkable. The mastoid air cells have scattered opacification. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered punctate foci of emboli throughout the cerberal hemispheres and possibly in the pons. No associated enhancement but given history of endocarditis these likely represent septic emboli. 2. There is a small meningioma along the right falx that measures 7 mm in greatest diameter. 3. Scattered opacification of the mastoid air cells. Wilson NP for CT surgery was informed of preliminary findings at 12 pm.
