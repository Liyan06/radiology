Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

There is again stable appearance of the encephalomalacia involvingthe left parietal lobe with ex vacuo dilatation of the leftoccipital horn and right frontal lobe.the more superior of the previously described two enhancingnodules anteriorly along the talks on the left has enlarged toapproximately 7 mm in diameter and now demonstrates a small focusof central hypoenhancement. The lower of the two left pre falcinenodules visually suggests increased in size. The differencessmall and may be accounted for by difference in head angulationand contrast timing. Now seen is a third similarly enhancingdural based nodule in the lateral right frontal region see image21 series 7 and image 26 series 8. Previously reported thirdmore superior focus of nodular enhancement is not appreciatedand present is unchanged. Findings compatible with priorcraniotomies in the frontal and left parietal regions are seen.There continues to be stable appearance of the T2/FLAIRhyperintense foci within the left corona radiata and centrum semiovale. There is no abnormal intra-axial enhancement. There is noacute intracranial hemorrhage midline shift mass effect orhydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Probable interval growth of two previously describedparafalcine enhancing nodules and appearance of new right lateralfrontal dural based nodule. the higher up to pre falcine nodulesdemonstrates central hypoenhancement. Continued follow-up advised.2. There is stable appearance of the encephalomalacia involvingthe left parietal lobe with ex vacuo dilatation of the leftoccipital horn and right frontal lobe.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStation
