Minimal dural enhancement is seen along the left frontal lobe in the surgical bed likely post-operative. No other areas of enhancement are present.

Multiple mucus retention cysts are in bilateral maxillary sinuses right greater than left. There is thickened and enhancing mucosa in the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid and frontal sinuses. CT can better assess bony integrity.
