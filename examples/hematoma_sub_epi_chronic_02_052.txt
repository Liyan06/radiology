Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated are post-surgical changes of right lateral craniectomy/cranioplasty with expected dural thickening and enhancement underlying the cranioplasty flap. Stable right lateral occipitoparietal cystic encephalomalacia underlying temporo-occipital craniectomy defect with stable surrounding T2 prolongation. Decreased size of left convexity subdural hematoma now measuring 4 mm maximum thickness over the lateral left frontal convexity. Slightly decreased size of right frontotemporal and anterior interhemispheric subdural hematoma now measuring 1-2 mm thick. No associated mass effect. Stable 2.5 cm planum sphenoidal/sellar/suprasellar partially calcified meningioma encasing the right supraclinoid internal carotid artery right M1 and A1 segments with preservation of flow void and elevating the right optic chiasm and cisternal right optic nerve right inferior frontal lobe and floor of the third ventricle. Stable mild right inferior frontal adjacent T2 prolongation. Stable pattern of scattered foci of T2 prolongation involving the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter of bilateral cerebral hemispheres nonspecific but likely reflecting chronic small vessel ischemia. Stable left frontal approach ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter terminating near the foramen of Monro. Stable gliosis surrounding the catheter tract. Stable moderate prominence of the ventricles and sulci for age. No transependymal edema. Basal cisterns are patent. Mild bimaxillary-ethmoidal sinus mucosal inflammatory changes.
IMPRESSION:

1. Slight decrease in bilateral subdural hematomas. 2. Stable right planum sphenoidalel/sellar/suprasellar meningioma with local mass effect and encasement as above 3. Stable moderate ventriculomegaly with stable left ventriculoperitoneal shunt. 4. Postsurgical changes as above.
