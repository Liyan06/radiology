Diseases: ['meningioma', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is redemonstration of postsurgical changes of a right frontal craniotomy. There is grossly stable appearance of the previously seen region of solid enhancement medial to the anterior clinoid immediately posterior to the right optic canal adjacent to the right supraclinoid carotid artery measuring 5 x 4 by 4 (AP by TR by CC) mm corresponding to image 11 of series 5 and image 11 of series 11. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. There is stable appearance of the prior lacunar infarcts involving the right caudate on image 16 series 8 and the right putamen on image 16 of series 8. There is overall stable appearance of circumscribed foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity that are nonspecific but likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is redemonstration of a small rounded area of signal abnormality in the region of the anterior third ventricle immediately posterior to the fornix measuring 3mm on images 14 of series 8 and and a14 of series 5 likely representing a colloid cyst. No additional focal brain parenchymal abnormalities. There is no extra-axial fluid collections or mass effect. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. There is stable prominence of the ventricles and sulci. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable. There is a proteinaceous retention cyst within the right sphenoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post right craniotomy for resection of a right clinoid region meningioma with grossly stable appearance of focus of solid enhancement medial to the anterior clinoid and immediately posterior to the right optic canal abutting the right carotid artery in keeping with small residual neoplasm. 2. Stable appearance of likely a colloid cyst at the anterior third ventricle. Ventricles are stable in size without acute hydrocephalus. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
