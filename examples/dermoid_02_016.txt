Diseases: ['dermoid']
FINDINGS:

There is prominence of cerebral ventricles and cortical sulci inkeeping with cerebral volume loss. On long TR sequences thereare areas of hyperintensity in the periventricular deep andsubcortical white matter mostlikely the sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. Basilarcisterns are patent. There is evidence of mass effect in thebrain.Evaluation of the orbits is limitted secondary to technique.Again demonstrated is a multicystic mass in the anterior rightorbit located in an extraconal location inferolateral to theglobe. This most likely represents a dermoid/epidermoid or lesslikely a cystic lymphangioma. Evaluation of the optic nerves islimitted secondary to technique.There is moderate to severe mucosal thickening of the leftsphenoid sinus which appears to extend into a left lateralpterygoid extension. Within the sphenoid sinus are areas ofintermediate signal intensity on T2 weighted imaging probablyinspissated secretions. Soft tissue and/or mucosal changes againappear to extend into the clivus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Areas of white matter signal abnormality in the brain mostlikely the sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.2. Extraconal cystic mass within the right orbit inferolateralto the anterior aspect of the right globe. Accounting fortechnical differencces it is unchanged. This is most likely aepidermoid cyst or potentially dermoid. Cystic lymphangioma isless likely.3. Sphenoid sinus disease unchanged with possible extension ofsoft tissue or mucosal changes into the clivus. This could befurther evaluated with CT scan of the sphenoid sinus with thinsectionsand axial and coronal planes4. In the future follow-up imaging should be performed as MRIBrain/Orbits.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
