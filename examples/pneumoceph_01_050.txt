Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

There are changes of a left fronto-temporal craniotomywith a left anterior insular and adjacent frontal/temporal loberesection cavity. There is postoperativeblood/fluid/pneumocephalus in the resection cavity and leftanterior subdural space. There is T2/FLAIR hyperintensitysurrounding the resection cavity some of which is residualunenhancing neoplasm. This T2/FLAIR hyperintensity extends intothe left frontal lobe and left anterior temporal lobe. T1hyperintense blood can obscure subtle enhancement. The vastmajority of the enhancing tissue appears to have been resected.There is meningeal enhancement adjacent to the resection cavity.There is stable 4 mm left to right midline shift.The remainder of the cerebrum demonstrates normal gray matter andgray/white differentiation. There is restricted diffusion withinthe left caudate head. This is suspicious for acute infarction.No abnormalities are seen in the midbrain pons medulla. Bothcerebellar hemispheres are normal in signal.The ventricles are stable in size and shape. The vascular flowvoids are unremarkable. The orbits are unremarkable. The sinusesdemonstrate no abnormalities. The visualized pharynx andparapharyngeal soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left anterior insular and adjacent frontal/temporal loberesection cavity with surrounding T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. T1hyperintense blood can obscure subtle enhancement. Non-enhancinginfiltrating neoplasm residual is present.2. Acute infarction of the left caudate head.3. Findings discussed with Dr. Brown from neurosurgery at thetime of interpretation on the 1-21-2006.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
