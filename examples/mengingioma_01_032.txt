Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is a similarly appearing extra-axial dural based mass centered in the left petroclival region measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.2 cm in sagittal plane and 1.6-cm in transverse dimension in coronal plane which is similar in appearance to most recent prior exam when measured in a similar fashion. This mass extends along the dorsal margin of the clivus to the level of the internal auditory canal and along the posterior margin of the body of the sphenoid/dorsum sella to the level of posterior clinoids. There is similar mild extension along the anterior tentorial leaflet on the left. There is similar effacement of the pre-pontine cistern with similar mild mass effect on the basilar artery and mild effacement of the ventral pons on the left. Similar mild asymmetric enhancement left more so than right cavernous sinus without frank evidence of extension of this mass into the cavernous sinus. Sellar contents are within normal limits. The pituitary stalk is not displaced. No territorial regions of restricted diffusion. Multiple scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity are noted within the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter which are nonspecific however greater than expected for patient age . No territorial regions of restricted diffusion. There are no extra-axial fluid collections. No midline shift. No ventriculomegaly. No discrete suspicious pathologic marrow signal changes. Imaged orbits are within normal limits. Probable mucus retention cysts bilateral maxillary sinuses. Increasing layering secretions left maxillary sinus. Mild ethmoidal mucosal changes.
IMPRESSION:

1. Overall similar appearance of enhancing extra-axial mass centered in the left petroclival region compatible with meningioma. 2. Increasing layering secretions left maxillary sinus. Correlate with symptoms/signs of sinonasal inflammation.
