Diseases: ['craniopharyngioma']
FINDINGS:

Right craniotomy. Left frontal approach ventricular drain with tip in the body of the left lateral ventricle. Vasogenic edema along the tract. Blood products and air are seen in the sellar/suprasellar region. There has been interval resolution of mass-effect and cystic mass in this area. Probably stable small extra-axial hematoma over the right convexity without significant mass effect or midline shift. Bilateral subdural fluid collections and air with minimal underlying mass effect anterior to the frontal lobes. Mild amount of layering blood in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles and in the superior interhemispheric pseudocyst. The appearance of the ventricular system is unchanged when compared with recent CT. Pachymeningeal enhancement is likely reactive and possibly related to intracranial hypotension. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells slightly progressed. The patient remains intubated. There is diffuse abnormal signal in the sulci possibly related to ventilation with high partial pressure of oxygen. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage is felt less likely.
IMPRESSION:

1. Expected post surgical changes related to craniopharyngioma resection. 2. No evidence of residual enhancement in surgical cavity. 3. Diffuse abnormal sulcal signal possibly related to high p02 ventilation. Diffuse subarachnoid blood felt less likely. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
