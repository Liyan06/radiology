Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There is an area of susceptibility in the region of the left suprasellar cistern in keeping with the presence of coils for embolization of the previously described left ICA aneurysm. There is also evidence of prior instrumentation in the left frontal calvarium with a small fluid collection clinical correlation. Flow voids in the other vessels are maintained. There has been mild interval volume loss. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are otherwise symmetric and patent. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute/subacute infarct. No evidence of central pontine or extra-pontine myelinolysis. There is a small area of encephalomalacia with surrounding gliosis in the anterior left temporal lobe likely representing a small chronic infarct. There are areas of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter likely representing the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is a right nasal route tube. There is high T1 signal throughout the pituitary gland raising suspicion for hemorrhage although the gland does not appear enlarged. There is heterogeneous marrow signal involving the calvarium and clivus possibly on the basis of chemotherapy.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of central pontine or extra-pontine myelinolysis. 2. High T1 signal in the pituitary gland raising suspicion for hemorrhage although the gland does not appear enlarged. 3. Evidence of prior instrumentation in the left frontal calvarium with small free collection clinical correlation. 4. Heterogeneous marrow signal in calvarium and clivus possibly on the basis of chemotherapy. 5. Prior coil embolization of left ICA aneurysm.
