Diseases: ['encephalitis', 'encephalomalacia', 'infarction']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated is abnormal T2 hyperintensity involving the medial left temporal lobe which demonstrates no areas of restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement. There is encephalomalacia of the posterior left parietal lobe with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the lateral ventricle in keeping with prior history of ischemic event in this area. There are nonspecific periventricular deep and subcortical white matter T2 hyperintensities which are likely on the basis of small vessel ischemic disease stable. No extra-axial fluid collections or mass effect. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable No abnormal enhancement in the brain or its coverings note is made of a mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. Again noted is stable appearance to the dysmorphic appearing right globe without visualization of the lens and with increased areas of susceptibility. Correlation with patient history recommended.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance to nonspecific T2 hyperintensity in the medial left temporal lobe no evidence of restricted diffusion or enhancement could still represent post ictal changes. Per referring team patient is still having subclinical seizures. Absence of enhancement makes infectious etiologies such as Herpes encephalitis less likely. However clinical/ EEG/ CSF correlation and follow up imaging would be useful. 2. Stable appearance to the dysmorphic appearing right globe as described above. Correlate with patient's history. 3. Stable left posterior parietal encephalomalacia status post infarction. 4. Probable sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
