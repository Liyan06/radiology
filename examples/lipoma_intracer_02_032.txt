Diseases: ['lipoma', 'lipoma']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and sulci are large in keeping with cerebral volume loss. The degree of ventricular enlargement is slightly disproportional to the degree of sulcal enlargement probably reflecting more central volume loss. Also again seen it is at the fatty lesion in the tectal plate/quadrigeminal plate cistern in keeping with a lipoma. The size of the lipoma is grossly stable compared to the prior examination. On the sagittal image is there is suggestion that a lipoma may have caused some narrowing at the inferior aspect of the cerebral aqueduct. However the size of the ventricles is grossly unchanged compared to the prior examination from 2006. There is no midline shift. There is no abnormal extra-axial fluid collection. Again seen is extensive periventricular deep and subcortical white matter T2 hyperintensity a nonspecific finding but like to representing small vessel ischemic changes. There are a few tiny old infarcts within the corona radiata. The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. The mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Cerebral volume loss. Stable size of enlarged ventricles. 2. Grossly stable appearance of tectal plate/quadrigeminal plate cistern lipoma. The lipoma appears to slightly narrow the inferior aspect of the cerebral aqueduct. 3. Extensive small vessel ischemic changes. A few tiny old infarcts within the corona radiata.
