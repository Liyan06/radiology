Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is a large arteriovenous malformation centered within the left occipital lobe. Some of the foci with loss of signal reflect embolization material present within the AVM as seen on the prior CT. There are numerous enlarged feeding arteries likely from both the anterior and posterior circulations. There is likely both superficial and deep venous drainage. Again seen are multiple enlarged superficial cerebral veins along the left posterior temporal and bilateral occipital lobes as well as bilateral enlarged perimesencephalic veins and cortical veins. There are small areas of gliosis within and adjacent to the AVM. The overall appearance is grossly stable in comparison to the prior study from 2/7/2008. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are stable and may be slightly prominent for age. There are few scattered small nonspecific foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the white matter. There is no abnormal restricted diffusion. There is no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. Evaluation of the temporal lobes demonstrate overall symmetry in size and normal signal intensity of the hippocampi and parahippocampal structures noting mild distortion of the anatomy on the left due to previously noted enlarged left temporal veins. No focal volume loss is identified. There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. The paranasal sinuses are otherwise grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Large arteriovenous malformation centered within the left occipital lobe as described grossly stable in comparison to the most recent prior study accounting for differences in technique. 2. Symmetric normal appearing hippocampi.
