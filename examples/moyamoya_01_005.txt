Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

MRI: There is gliosis and encephalomalacia involving the left parietal lobe mostly the sequelae of old infarction. There are several small foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity in left anterior frontal lobe and in the left centrum semi-ovale (series 8 image 22) and adjacent to the posterior aspect of the left globus pallidus. These findings are unchanged in comparison to MRI of the brain dated September 5 2003. No abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma. No leptomeningeal enhancement. No masses. No midline shift. No acute infarction. No intracranial hematoma. No extra-axial collection. There is mild mucosal thickening involving the left maxillary sinus. The rest of the paranasal sinuses are clear. There is fluid in the left mastoid air cells. These findings were present on CT angiogram dated August 11 2011. The orbits are normal. MRA: redemonstrated again a 6 x 4 mm saccular aneurysm with a broad base arising from proximal left A1. The left M1 is occluded. There are innumerable small collaterals in the left sylvian fissure and at the region of the left lenticulostriate arteries representing focal moyamoya. The small 3-mm arterial filling arising from one of the perforator arteries of the occluded left M1 is again identified unchanged in comparison to CT angiogram.
IMPRESSION:

1. The MR angiogram findings are unchanged in comparison to CT angiogram findings dated August 11 2011. Focal left-sided moyamoya occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral artery and a saccular aneurysm arising from the proximal left A1. Small 3-mm aneurysm arising from one of the perforator arteries on the left side. 2. The findings in the brain parenchyma are unchanged in comparison to MRI of the brain dated September 5 2003. No MRI findings of CNS infection. Please note that this does not rule-out infectious processes in the CNS.
