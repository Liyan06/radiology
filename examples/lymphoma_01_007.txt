FINDINGS:

There is interval increase in size (from 6 to 14 mm) of mildly enhancing focus of flair hyperintensity in the left occipital subcortical white matter. The lesion now to demonstrates small amount of T1 shortening and facilitated diffusion. No other lesions are seen. There is no acute ischemia extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Incidental note is made of stable encephalomalacia of the left inferior medial cerebellar hemisphere. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. There is partial fluid opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally. The previously noted right node of Rouviere is not visualized on the current study.
IMPRESSION:

1. Increase in size of a focal signal abnormality with mild enhancement and now T1 shortening. The latter may represent small amount of blood products. Overall picture is still nonspecific and may be seen with focal encephalitis metastasis late subacute infarct. Consider follow-up imaging with perfusion and spectroscopy. 2. Fluid opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells. Attending interpretation: Modification of above report. I agree that the focus of T2 prolongation in the left occipital subcortical white matter has increased in size. This also demonstrates increased homogeneous enhancement. The diffusion sequences do not demonstrate facilitated diffusion as mentioned above however they do demonstrate restricted diffusion. Given the constellation of findings I favor this represents lymphoma. MR perfusion and spectroscopy should also be considered for additional characterization. Also there is hypoplasia of the left cerebellum likely congenital variation. Finally there is diffuse low signal intensity on T1 weighted images within the upper cervical spine and clivus suspicious for marrow infiltrative process (including lymphoma).
