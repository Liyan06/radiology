Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

The patient is status post a right temporal craniotomy withexpected postoperative changes including subgaleal fluidcollection and air mild intracranial air and mild duralenhancement. Soft tissue abnormality noted in the suprasellarregion without evidence of enhancement questionable for residualtumor versus postoperative debris. Comparison to preoperativefilms would be of value.Signal abnormality is noted in the right temporal lobe and rightinferior frontal lobe with restricted diffusion consistent withinfarction of these regions. The cerebral ventricles corticalsulci and basal cisterns are unremarkable.There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses.Otherwise the paranasal sinuses appear clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post a right temporal craniotomy for resection ofcraniopharyngioma with expected postoperative changes as detailedabove. Soft tissue abnormality is noted in the suprasellarregion without enhancement questionable for residual tumorversus postoperative debris. Comparison to preoperative imagingwould be useful in differentiation.2. Area of acute infarction involving the right temporal lobe andright inferior frontal lobe.Findings discussed with Dr. Malhotra of neurosurgery uponcompletion of the study.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
