Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Again noted there is no flow in the right sigmoid sinus and rightinternal jugular vein in keeping with venous thrombosis. The flow inthe right transverse sinus is segmentally seen suggesting partiallyrecanalized right transverse sinus thrombosis. The overall appearanceis stable from the previous examination.MRI examination of the brain showed diffuse periventricular high T2signal which is a nonspecific finding but felt to represent smallvessel ischemic disease. An enhancing dural based lesion is againnoted in the left frontotemporal region most likely representing ameningioma. This lesion is stable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable thrombosis of the right sigmoid sinuses and right internaljugular vein. The right transverse sinus is probably thrombosed withpartial recanalization. These findings are unchanged from theprevious examination.2. Stable dural based enhancing lesion in the left temporoparietalregion likely representing a meningioma.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: HERSKOVITS EDWARD H MD
