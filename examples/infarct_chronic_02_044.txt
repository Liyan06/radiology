Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

MRI of the brain:There is stable encephalomalacia in the right parietal lobe withaccompanying parenchymal T2 hyperintensity representing gliosis probably from prior watershed infarction. There are multiplestable T2 hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcorticalwhite matter compatible with moderate small vessel ischemicdisease. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise appear normal.There is no abnormal enhancement.There is a new focus of restricted diffusion in the rightcerebellar hemisphere representing a small acute infarct in theright PICA distribution.MRA of the brain:There is no intracranial aneurysm. There is no hemodynamicallysignificant stenosis.MRA of the neck:The right internal carotid artery has a partially retropharyngealcourse. There is mild irregularity and minimal stenosis of theorigin of the right internal carotid artery.
IMPRESSION:

1. Small new focus of restricted diffusion in the rightcerebellar hemisphere representing an acute infarct in the rightPICA distribution.2. Stable right parietal lobe encephalomalacia probably fromprior watershed infarct. Stable white matter disease compatiblewith chronic small vessel ischemia.3. No hemodynamically significant stenosis of the intracranial orneck vasculature.Addendum:Addendum:Multifocal hemosiderin deposition posteriorly bilaterally suggestive of but not diagnostic of amyloid angiopathy.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStationAddended by: Interface TalkStation
