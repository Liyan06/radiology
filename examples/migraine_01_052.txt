Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Mild scattered nonspecific nonenhancing subcortical and periventricular white matter flair hyperintensities are identified in a patient this age this can be seen with migraine seizure demyelinating disease and multiple infectious and inflammatory processes. The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. No evidence of mass mass effect midline shift or acute territorial infarction. No evidence of intra or extra-axial hemorrhage. The ventricles and basilar cisterns are symmetric and patent. Incidentally noted is mild cerebellar tonsillar ectopia right greater than left which does not meet criteria for a Chiari malformation. The hippocampi are symmetric in size and signal characteristics with normal architecture. No evidence of focal cortical dysplasia or other migrational abnormality. No areas of opacification of a left anterior ethmoid air cell remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. Incidental note made of a hypoplastic left A1 segment a normal congenital variant. There is patency of the intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segements. There are no regions of focal stenosis or aneurysm formation. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. No intracranial abnormality. Specifically no evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis focal cortical dysplasia or migrational abnormality. 2. Patency of the intracranial circulation without evidence of aneurysm formation as above.
