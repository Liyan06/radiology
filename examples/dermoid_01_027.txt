Diseases: ['lipoma', 'dermoid']
FINDINGS:

Images are mildly degraded by patient motion. Redemonstrated is a fat containing extra-axial mass overlying the left parietal vertex with a stable small protrusion into the central sulcus. There are stable punctate regions of susceptibility within the mass which may correspond with the calcifications identified on prior CT head examination. Several blood vessels course immediately adjacent to and within the mass unchanged since prior examination. No definite enhancement is identified on the postcontrast fat saturated images. No additional extra-axial masses are identified. No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarcts. No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain or its covering. Redemonstrated are scattered subcortical periventricular and deep white matter flair hyperintensities this is a nonspecific finding but in this patient's age group commonly associated with chronic small vessel ischemic change. The ventricles and basal cisterns are patent.. Incidental note made of cavum septum pellucidum. Redemonstrated is decreased signal in the bone marrow of the upper cervical spine similar to prior examination this is a nonspecific finding but can be seen in the setting of anemia and other myeloproliferative disorders or chronic hypoxic states including smoking clinically correlate. There are mild mucosal changes in the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of left parietal convexity mass likely representing a lipoma or dermoid. 2. Nonspecific white matter flair signal changes similar to prior examination clinically correlate. 3. Stable signal abnormality within the visualized cervical spine bone marrow likely representing bone marrow reconversion clinically correlate. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
