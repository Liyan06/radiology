Diseases: ['astrocytoma', 'lymphoma']
FINDINGS:

There is abnormal T2 hyperintensity in the right thalamus hypothalamus right optic tract and right cerebral peduncle. There is also involvement of the medial left thalamus and possibly left optic tract. Two additional foci of abnormal signal are present in the left posterior thalamus and there is also mild signal abnormality within the pons. There may be mild associated restricted diffusion anteriorly but this is not confirmed on the ADC maps. A curvilinear focus of enhancement is present in the right inferior thalamus (best seen on coronal images). A 27 x 16 mm cyst is present associated with the right lateral ventricle likely representing ependymal cyst or arachnoid cyst. There is no associated enhancement. The remaining brain parenchyma is within normal limits. There is no mass effect or midline shift. There is no evidence for acute hemorrhage or acute transcortical infarct. Paranasal sinuses are clear. There is herniation of fat through an inferior orbital wall fracture-deformity. Extraocular muscles are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal signal intensity within the right thalamus hypothalamus optic tracts and cerebral peduncle with mild amount in the pons. No definite restricted diffusion. Curvilinear focus of enhancement within the signal abnormality. Differential considerations include low-grade astrocytoma infectious/inflammatory etiology and less likely lymphoma. Advanced imaging is recommended. 2. Ependymal versus arachnoid cyst right lateral ventricle. 3. Probable old left inferior orbital wall blow out fracture. Correlation is recommended. See above. Preliminary findings discussed with Dr. Lee at 7pm on 8/6/08. FINAL ATTENDING
