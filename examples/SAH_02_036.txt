Diseases: ['thrombosis', 'thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Images are mildly degraded by motion. Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage is present along the sulci in the right frontal parietal and temporal lobes with several foci of restricted diffusion in these regions. Increased susceptibility corresponding to the subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen on the gradient echo sequence. There is an apparent prominent flow void on the T2 weighted images along the right temporal lobe with corresponding low signal intensity on flair images and signal abnormality on the T1-weighted images concerning for cortical vein thrombosis involving the right vein of Labbe (series 24 image 6-14); this cannot however be clearly confirmed on the gradient echo sequence. The superior sagittal sinus straight sinus bilateral transverse and sigmoid sinuses are patent. There is no midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal parietal and temporal lobes with several foci of restricted diffusion. MR evidence concerning for cortical vein thrombosis involving the right vein of Labbe although this cannot be clearly confirmed on the gradient echo sequence. Conventional angiography may be helpful for confirmation if indicated. Dural venous sinuses are patent. Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. Mackenzie. Attending review: I do not definitely appreciate cortical venous thrombosis in a location to explain the hemorrhage and ischemic changes. On the affected side there is a patent vein of Labbe without a dominant vein of Trolard several cortical veins in that terrritory appear to be patent within the limits of this motion limited study.
