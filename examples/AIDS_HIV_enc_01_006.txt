Diseases: ['meningitis', 'encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There is an extra-axial collection extending over the left cerebral hemisphere and right occipitoparietal region measuring 5 mm overlying the left parietal region with mild associated dural thickening. No restricted diffusion is noted. There is also enhancement of the thickened dura overlying the left posterior frontal and parietal regions. There is mild mass effect with approximately 2 to 3 mm of left-to-right midline shift. Increased T2 signal is seen in the cortical region of the insular cortex. There is decreased bone marrow signal representing anemia of chronic disease. There is slightly increased T2 signal in the periventricular and white matter without enhancement likely related to oxygen content from intubation. The ventricles cortical sulci and basal cisterns are unchanged in size and appearance. There is no evidence of acute transcortical infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No mass is seen. Incidental note is made of a small cavum septum pellucidum. Patient is intubated. There is mucosal disease in the sphenoid sinus and bilateral maxillary sinuses with air-fluid levels possibly representing acute sinusitis. Mucous retention cyst seen in the left maxillary sinus. The dural sinuses are patent. Again noted is opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Subdural collection with mild dural thickening and mild enhancement as described more prominent on the left with mild right to left midline shift. Meningitis or encephalitis cannot be excluded. CT of the head should be repeated to compare with the prior CT for change in size of subdural collection. 2. Increased T2 signal in the periventricular and white matter without enhancement which could represent the effects of oxygen given that the patient is intubated. The appearance is not characteristic of PML. 3. Decreased bone marrow signal from anemia of chronic disease.
