Diseases: ['meningioma', 'encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstrated are postsurgical changes consistent with left temporal craniotomy and resection of left temporal meningioma. Interval resolution of the immmediate postsurgical changes including surgical hemorrhage and extra-axial fluid collection. T2 and flair hyperintense signal noted within the left anterior temporal lobe consistent with evolving encephalomalacia. Dural thickening and enhancement noted at the craniotomy site likely postsurgical. Additionally there is a region of irregular and nodular dural thickening which enhances adjacent to the left frontal lobe and along the edge of the tentorium on the left(series 8 image 19 and series 8 image 10 respectively) which may also reflect surgical sequela however residual meningioma cannot be completely excluded and continued follow-up with attention to these regions is suggested. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarcts. No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain. Ventricles and cisterns are symmetric and patent. Major arterial flow voids at the skull base appear maintained. Redemonstrated is signal abnormality within the left distal transverse and sigmoid sinus suggesting thrombosis. Mild mucosal disease noted in the ethmoid air cells. Small amount of fluid at the left mastoid tip unchanged.
IMPRESSION:

1. Focal region of irregular nodular enhancing dural thickening adjacent to the left frontal lobe and posterior margin of the left tentorium which may reflect sequela of surgery however residual meningioma cannot be completely excluded. Follow-up with close attention to these areas is advised. Details above. 2. Evolving postsurgical changes as above. Evolving left temporal lobe encephalomalacia.
