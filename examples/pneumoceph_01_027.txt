Diseases: ['glioblastoma', 'meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There has been interval left frontal craniotomy and partial resection of the left frontal mass. Small amount of residual enhancement is present in the genu of the corpus callosum (series 10 image 17). There is increasing sulcal effacement in the left hemisphere and increasing left to right midline shift currently measuring approximately 9 mm previously 7.5 mm. Ventricles are stable in size. Basal cisterns are patent. Blood products are present within the surgical cavity. There is a small left frontal extra-axial collection measuring 7 mm in greatest transverse dimension as well as pneumocephalus over the left frontal convexity and anterior to the left temporal tip. Skin staples and a small left frontotemporal scalp air-fluid collection is present post-surgical in nature. Dural enhancement on the left is likely postsurgical in nature. Apparent leptomeningeal enhancement in the left hemisphere likely represents venous congestion secondary to increasing sulcal effacement. T2 prolongation in the periventricular deep and subcortical white matter is similar in appearance to 9/20/08. Postsurgical changes are present within the tuberculum sella region from prior meningioma resection. There is volume loss in the right frontal lobe stable from 4/28/09. Orbital contents are within normal limits. Small amount of fluid is present in the sphenoid sinus likely secondary to recent intubation. Remaining paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post resection of left frontal mass preliminary diagnosis is glioblastoma. Small amount of residual enhancement in the genu of the corpus callosum on the left. Stable T2 prolongation as above. 2. Postsurgical changes from tuberculum sella meningioma resection. Discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Halpern at 1015 am on 5/23/09.
