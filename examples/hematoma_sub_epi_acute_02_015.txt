Diseases: ['hematoma', 'hematoma', 'empyema']
FINDINGS:

Diffusion-weighted images show no evidence of acute ischemia. Redemonstrated is mixed intensity left extra-axial collection consistent with subdural hematoma likely mixed ages of blood and concordant with comparison CT. There is minimal subarachnoid blood is seen on FLAIR images and subdural blood extends anteriorly along interhemispheric fissure at left sulcus. There is a small focus of susceptibility in the right head of the caudate nucleus not seen on other sequences etiology uncertain possibly capillary telangiectasia or cavernoma less likely old micro-bleed. There is partial opacification of the right maxillary sinus with possible layering material stable compared to prior but appearing since May 6 2011. Mucosal thickening in left maxillary sinus and right more than left ethmoid air cells also noted.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute ischemia. 2. Mixed intensity subdural hematoma over left convexity extending along interhemispheric fissure medially as well evidence of subarachnoid blood in sulci on the left also noted which is not easily appreciated on the comparison CT. Possibilities other than blood include pus but left subdural hematoma appears primarily diffusion-dark with some material with decreased diffusion coefficient anteriorly though suspect this is blood products as opposed to empyema. Correlate clinically follow up as clinically indicated. 3. Small focus of susceptibility in the right head of the caudate nucleus not seen on other sequences etiology uncertain and possibly capillary telangiectasia or cavernoma.
