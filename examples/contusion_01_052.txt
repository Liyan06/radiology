Diseases: ['normal', 'meningioma', 'encephalomalacia', 'contusion']
FINDINGS:

Again noted are postsurgical changes related to prior right temporoparietal craniotomy for resection of meningioma. Stable post operative gliosis and encephalomalacia in the right frontal and temporal opercula. Encephalomalacia in inferior left temporal lobe and in left gyrus rectus (series 9 images 21 and 31) most likely from prior traumatic contusion. Focus of increased T2 and FLAIR signal intensity in posterior limb of right internal capsule unchanged from prior study postoperative or due to ischemia. No acute infarction masses midline shift intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. The ventricles and basal cisterns are patent. The hippocampi are normal in morphology and size and signal intensity. The lateral ventricle temporal lobes are symmetric. No evidence of gray matter heterotopia. There is no evidence of hemosiderin deposition. There is near complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus similar to prior exam. There is partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells. Stable mucosal thickening in the frontal sinuses. There is fluid within the posterior left mastoid air cells stable from prior exam. There is a small tornwaldt cyst.
IMPRESSION:

1. Normal appearance of the hippocampi. 2. Stable postsurgical changes related to right temporoparietal craniotomy for resection of meningioma. Stable encephalomalacia in inferior left temporal and frontal lobes from prior traumatic contusion. 3. Stable findings of sinus disease.
