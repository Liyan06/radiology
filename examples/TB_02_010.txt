Diseases: ['tuberculosis']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple susceptibility foci within the sulci and parenchyma of both the cerebrum and cerebellum as well as adjacent the right frontal horn. There are no associated T2/ FLAIR signal abnormality or enhancement. No evidence of mass lesions. There is no areas of restricted diffusion the brain. The ventricles and sulci are patent. There is no extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Evaluation of the temporal lobes demonstrate asymmetric atrophic appearance of the left hippocampus. The left temporal horn is slightly larger than the right. Minimal increased FLAIR signal intensity. Postcontrast images demonstrate no abnormal enhancement. The paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Asymmetric atrophic appearance of the left hippocampus with prominent left temporal horn and minimal increased FLAIR signal intensity findings concerning for left mesial temporal sclerosis. Advise clinical/EEG correlation. 2. Multiple susceptibility foci within the sulci and parenchyma of both the cerebrum and cerebellum as well as in the right frontal horn without associated T2 abnormality or enhancement. Findings are in keeping with nodular calcified stage of neurocysticercosis. Alternatively sequela from prior granulomatous infection such as tuberculosis or less likely cavernomas may have similar appearance. No evidence of abnormal enhancement or mass lesions. ***ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I agree with the preliminary report without modification. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
