Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Images are degraded by motion. There are multiple areas of restricted diffusion involving bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and right thalamus suggestive of multiple acute infarcts. There is minimal mass effect. There is no midline shift. There is no extra-axial fluid collection or evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. There is asymmetric signal in the left transverse/sigmoid sinuses also seen in the left internal jugular vein relatively T2 hyperintense compared to the opposite side favor this secondary to technical factors and/ or slow flow over venous thrombosis. This can be further evaluated with additional imaging as clinically indicated. Mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral frontal and right maxillary sinuses. There is patency of the bilateral vertebral arteries. Bilateral common carotid cervical internal carotid and external carotid arteries are patent. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis. An oroenteric tube and endotracheal tube are present.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple acute infarcts involving bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and in the right thalamus. Consider cardioembolic source. 2. Patent neck vasculature. 3. Asymmetric signal in the left transverse/ sigmoid sinuses also seen in the left internal jugular vein relatively T2 hyperintense compared to the opposite side favor this secondary to technical factors and/ or slow flow over venous thrombosis. This can be further evaluated with additional imaging as clinically indicated. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation and agree with the findings in this report.
