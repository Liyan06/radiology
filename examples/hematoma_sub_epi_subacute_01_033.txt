Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Again noted is a subacute right subdural hematoma with mild masseffect on the right cerebrum with mild sulcal effacement withminimal interval increase in size. There is minimal midlineshift. The cerebral ventricles cortical sulci and basal cisternsare unremarkable. There are no abnormal areas of restricteddiffusion. There is mild dural enhancement likely related to thesubdural hematoma.There are extensive confluent as well as multifocal regions ofincreased signal intensity in the periventricular white matter inthe subcortical and deep white matter in the deep gray matter ofthe basal ganglia and the white matter tracks of the corpusstriatum and there are few in the pons. These are not associatedmass effect. Following contrast administration there is nopathologic enhancement.
IMPRESSION:
