Diseases: ['cadasil']
FINDINGS:

The images are degraded by motion. Extensive bilateral confluent symmetric areas of T2 elongation and noted in the periventricle deep and subcortical white matter with inconsistent involvement of the U-fibers. The abnormality involves olds of bilateral hemispheres with sparing of deep gray matter structures. There is no parenchymal volume loss. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage acute ischemia extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Incidental note is made of T1 shortening and susceptibility without adjacent edema in bilateral basal ganglia likely related to mineralization. [Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement.] Incidental note is made of mild nonspecific dilatation of bilateral optic sheaths. There is circumferential mucosal thickening bilateral ethmoid air cells. The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Incidental note is made of a left concha bullosa. There is an enhancing 4 mm focus in the left frontal calvarium on image 27 of series 8 likely a small hemangioma.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute ischemia or hemorrhage. 2. Extensive nonspecific bilaterally symmetric confluent areas of T2 elongation and bilateral surgical deep and subcortical white matter without evidence of parenchymal volume loss or involvement of the deep gray structures. The diagnostic considerations include metabolic disorders toxic exposure hypothyroidism radiation late onset of CADASIL or unusual presentation of ADEM are less likely. Correlation with patient's history and clinical presentation is advised. CSF analysis may be considered. After unsuccessful attempts to contact the residents on the service a call to Dr. Bird's office was made with request for additional information.
