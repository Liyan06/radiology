Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is mild diffuse brain volume loss with associated prominence of the ventricles and sulci. There are extensive regions of restricted diffusion in the left cerebral hemisphere in the left ACA territory consistent with acute ischemia. High T2/flair signal abnormality is present in the bilateral subcortical and periventricular white matter nonspecific but likely representing sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic change. An old right cerebellar infarct is visualized. A vague 7 mm region of enhancement is present in the superficial left frontal lobe near the vertex (series 9 image 19; series 8 image 28) possibly representing a developmental venous anomaly/telangiectasia. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI evidence for large left ACA vascular territory acute infarct as above. Probable sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic change. 2. Subcentimeter region of enhancement in the left frontal lobe near the vertex possibly representing a small developmental venous anomaly/telangiectasia. Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. Mehta. ATTENDING INTERPRETATION: I agree with the above report with the following editions/modifications. I agree that there areas of subacute infarction in the left cerebrum. There are areas of subacute ischemia involving the left anterior cerebral artery a focus in the left posterior cerebral artery (series 3 image 22) as well as foci in a watershed distribution. There are findings consistent with prior hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia. I also note a small left cerebellar infarct. The area of enhancement in the left frontal lobe may be sequela of evolving ischemia. This can be evaluated with follow-up imaging. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
