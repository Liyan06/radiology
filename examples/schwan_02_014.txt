Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

Study degraded from motion artifact. Brain: Redemonstrated are numerous foci of increased signal intensity within bilateral cerebral white matter and to a lesser extent the brainstem and cerebellum. Following contrast administration none demonstrate enhancement. No diffusion restriction. No intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Bilateral lens surgery. Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses demonstrates mild mucosal changes. Spine: Evaluation of the cervical and thoracic spine demonstrates normal alignment. There are degenerative changes. No focal marrow lesions are identified. The cervical and thoracic spinal cord are intrinsically normal in size without focal regions of volume loss or expansion. T2-weighted images show patchy areas of hyperintensity but no definite lesions that could be confirmed on 2 planes. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement in the cord. Again evidence of enhancing lesion in the left sided foramen at C7 -T1 suggestive of a nerve sheath tumor. There is no significant change from the prior study and the lesion appears similar to studies going back to 2001. Spondylotic changes. Heterogeneous bone marrow. Renal cysts.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings in the brain are consistent with the given diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. No convincing new or enhancing lesions are seen 2. Stable likely schwannoma at the left C7-T1 foramen. Spondylotic changes. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
