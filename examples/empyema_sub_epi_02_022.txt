FINDINGS:

Changes of right frontotemporal craniotomy are redemonstrated with evolution of post surgical changes since July 14 2010. This includes improvement in extra-axial fluid and air are seen at that time and there is also decreased edema in the frontotemporal region in vasogenic pattern. Foci of cytotoxic edema right anterior temporal pole and around the surgical site have evolved appropriately and now appear more encephalomalacic. However there is a new 8 x 23 mm extra-axial collection anteriorly over the right frontal pole (best seen on series 8 image 23) medial to edge of craniotomy subdural vs. epidural. This is surrounded by dural and leptomeningeal enhancement and there is dural enhancement over the right convexity as well. There is enhancement and flair signal abnormality and subarachnoid spaces suggestive of leptomeningeal involvement and the collection anteriorly is diffusion-bright and ADC dark suggestive of restricted diffusion and concerning for empyema. Degree of mass effect has improved since the prior study with no midline shift and no with ex vacuo dilatation of right lateral ventricle which was previously partially effaced. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. No other changes since prior.
IMPRESSION:

1. Empyema over right frontal pole with evidence of pachymeningitis and also leptomeningeal inflammation including enhancement with possible infected material in sulci over the right frontal convexity. If dura has been recently opened subarachnoid space abnormality could reflect component of subarachnoid blood but note is made that the small suspected empyema is medial to the edge of the craniotomy. 2. Evolving postsurgical changes since July 14 2010 and appropriate evolution of prior foci of cytotoxic edema overall decrease in mass effect.
