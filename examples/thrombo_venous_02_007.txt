Diseases: ['metastasis', 'thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

Again noted is a large hemorrhage in the right temporal and occipital lobes as well as satellite foci of hemorhage in the right parietal lobe. There is marked edema of the right cerebral hemisphere greatest in the temporal parietal and occipital lobes with effacement of the sulci and mass effect on the lateral ventricle which is nearly totally effaced. There is stable midline shift compared to the prior CT with 7 mm midline displacement to the left. There is mild subfalcine herniation. There are several areas of abnormal enhancement in the right occipital and parietal lobes. On image 85/series 10 an occipital focus of diffuse enhancement measures 2.5 x 1.6 cm. On image 138 in the right parietal lobe a lesion measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm and demonstrates ring enhancement. There is a filling defect in the right transverse and sigmoid sinuses representing sinus thrombosis. There is a small subdural hematoma along the lateral right frontal lobe and a subdural hematoma in the right posterior fossa. The bony calvarium is intact. The orbits are unremarkable. The sinuses and mastoid air cells demonstrates no abnormalities. The visualized pharynx and parapharyngeal soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Abnormal enhancement in the right occipital and temporal lobes with marked mass effect edema and hemorrhage probably representing hemorrhagic metastases in this patient with a lung mass. The irregular enhancement in the right occipital lobe raises the possibility of a primary tumor such as glioma although it is somewhat unpalatable to give the patient two diagnoses. Perhaps the irregular enhancement is a result of a combination of metastasis and venous infarct. 2. Right transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. 3. Right frontal and right posterior fossa subdural hematomas. Findings discussed with Dr. Stiefel of neurosurgery on 9/9/09 at 9 am.
