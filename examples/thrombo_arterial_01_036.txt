Diseases: ['thrombosis']
FINDINGS:

MRI brain: Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric patent and stable in size. No extraaxial fluid collections or mass effect. There is no acute/subacute infarct. There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There are few scattered foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the white matter nonspecific. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior arterial circulation. Pituitary fossa and posterior fossa are unremarkable. There is a staphyloma in the right globe. There is deformity with prior scleral banding of the left globe. No abnormal enhancing lesions in the brain or its covering. The cerebellar tonsils are slightly low-lying. There is mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and left ethmoid air cells. There is opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Clinical correlation. MRV: There is thrombus in the superior sagittal sinus with only partial canalization. There is near-complete thrombosis of the right transverse sinus and right sigmoid sinus and thrombosis of the right jugular vein. There is thrombus in the left transverse sinus and left sigmoid sinus with partial canalization of these vessels. The straight sinus appears patent and does not appear expanded. Again noted are prominent cortical draining veins. Overall and taking into account differences in technique there is probably no significant interval change.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intraparenchymal abnormality. 2. Persistent venous sinus thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus the transverse and sigmoid sinuses right greater than left and the left jugular vein. Probably no significant interval change.
