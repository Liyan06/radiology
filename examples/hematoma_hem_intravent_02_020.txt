Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is a large amount of intraventricular hemorrhage within the left lateral ventricle and extending into the anterior third ventricle new from the prior CT of November 11 2012. The lateral third and fourth ventricles are enlarged slightly increased in size when compared with the prior exam of November 11 2012 and markedly increased in size when compared with a prior MRI of May 11 2010. There is no evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There are no findings of acute ischemia. Intracranial flow voids are preserved. There is no midline shift. The basal cisterns are patent. There is generalized prominence of the cerebral sulci and CSF spaces reflecting generalized cerebral volume loss greater than expected for the patient's age. There are few nonspecific scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the periventricular white matter and subcortical white matter noting a prominent focus in the left parietal subcortical white matter without mass effect (image 22 of series 8). There is no pathologic enhancement. There is trace mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses are essentially clear. The mastoid air cells are clear. There is mild rightward bowing of the nasal septum. The orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Large amount of intraventricular hemorrhage predominantly in left lateral ventricle with extension into anterior third ventricle. Slight interval increase in size of ventricular system from November 11 2012 which may reflect developing hydrocephalus. 2. Generalized cerebral volume loss.
