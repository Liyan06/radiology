Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

MRI examination of the brain was performed usingsagittal T1 axial T2 FLAIR diffusion and axial and coronalpost contrast T1 weighted sequences. MRA of the head wasperformed using 3-D time-of-flight technique. Comparison is madewith study from 5 August 2003.Since the last examination has been interval development ofseveral small infarcts. There are two small infarcts in the leftcerebellar hemisphere. There is a small infarct within the rightcorona radiata. None of these demonstrate restricted diffusion.There are other scattered areas of signal abnormality on thelong-TR sequences likely related to small vessel ischemicdisease. Upon administration of intravenous contrast there is noabnormal enhancement.MRA the head demonstrates no abnormalities. There is normalappearance of the petrous cavernous and supraclinoid internalcarotid artery. There is normal appearance of the anterior andmiddle cerebral arteries and their proximal branches. Posteriorlyboth vertebral arteries are unremarkable and flow into anormal-appearing basilar artery. Both posterior cerebral arteriesare unremarkable. There are no aneurysms or vascularmalformations.
IMPRESSION:

1. MRI brain demonstrates interval development of several smallinfarcts within the left cerebellar hemisphere and right-sidedwhite matter. There are no acute infarcts.2. Normal MRA of the intracranial circulation. However pleasenote that mycotic aneurysms are better demonstrated onconventional angiography. Please consider this if there isfurther clinical concern.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStation
