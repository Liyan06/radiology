Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Multiple enhancing lesions within the supra-and infratentorial compartments. There is a 2.9-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding vasogenic edema and a 2.5-cm similar-looking lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Both of these lesions cause moderate mass effect. In the sagittal views there is suggestion of mild anterior displacement of the brainstem by the cerebellar mass effect. There is a 5 mm or less lesions seen in the patient's left parietal lobe a probable third cerebellar lesion close to midline in anterior right temporal lesion and several areas of suspicious enhancement in the peripheral cerebral hemispheres. This could be better demonstrated using higher dose contrast or magnetization transfer technique if absolute number of lesions is of significance. Scattered periventricular white matter T2/flair signal abnormality in keeping with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No extra-axial fluid collection. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable
IMPRESSION:

1. Greater than five enhancing supra-and infra-tentorial lesions in keeping with metastatic disease in view of the patient's history. 2. Moderate mass effect due to two dominant enhancing lesions in the cerebellar hemispheres as described above but without obstructive hydrocephalus. 3. Mild anterior displacement of the brainstem by the cerebellar mass effect. . I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
