FINDINGS:

Some images are degraded due to motion artifact. The right MCA territory including the insula frontal parietal temporal lobes and corona radiata demonstrates encephalomalacia with residual gyriform enhancement and no restricted diffusion consistent with evolving now chronic infarct. There is extension into the right basal ganglia. Old infarcts involving the left centrum semiovale and external capsule are again noted. There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest interval acute infarct. There has been interval progressive enlargement of the ventricles since October 2 2008 consistent with hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of gross transependymal CSF flow. There is stable T2/flair hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter. The basilar tip partially thrombosed aneurysm shows interval increase in size of the entire aneurysm measuring 2.5 x 2.8 cm (transverse and AP dimensisons) versus previous measurement of 1.9 x 2.5 cm. The patent lumen measures less than 1cm with surrounding enhancing clot. There is stable to slightly increased mass effect upon the right-sided pons/midbrain and posterior aspect of the third ventricle and cerebral aqueduct. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Expanding thrombosed basilar tip aneurysm probably a combination of expanding clot and true lumen. 2. Progressive interval enlargement of ventricular system over serial examinations consistent with hydrocephalus. This may reflect a combination of obstructive from the mass effect of the aneurysm as well as communicating from subarachnoid hemorrhage seen on prior studies. 3. No gross intracranial metastasis. Small lesions could be missed. 4. Evolving large right MCA territory infarct with enhancement in petechial hemorrhage has evolved. Final attending interpretation called to and acknowledged by Dr. Tracy Evans.
