Diseases: ['hemangioblastoma']
FINDINGS:

There are changes of interval left occipital craniotomy and resection of left cerebellar hemangioblastoma. There is mild abnormal signal surrounding the surgical cavity but no residual enhancing foci in the surgical cavity to suggest recurrence or residual tumor. Encephalomalacia and adjacent dural thickening and enhancement consistent with postoperative status. In comparison to MRI of the brain performed in 2003 there is slow but progressive loss of volume in the mesial temporal lobes on both sides more on the left than on the right side with volume loss of the hippocampi and prominence of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles. Small focus of old cortical and subcortical infarction in the left occipital lobe unchanged. No acute infarction new masses midline shift intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection or abnormal enhancement within the brain parenchyma. Slight convexity of the superior aspect of the pituitary gland slightly increased in comparison to 2003. Correlation with hormonal status is recommended and if necessary a dedicated MRI of the sella can be performed. Mucus retention cyst in the sphenoid sinus and in the right posterior ethmoidal air cells. The orbits are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Postoperative changes of left occipital craniotomy and resection of hemangioblastoma with no evidence of residual or recurrence of the tumor. 2. Slow but progressive volume loss of the mesial temporal lobes involving the hippocampi since 2003. 3. Slight convexity of the superior aspect of the pituitary gland slightly increased in comparison to 2003. Correlation with hormonal status is recommended and if necessary a dedicated MRI of the sella can be performed. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
