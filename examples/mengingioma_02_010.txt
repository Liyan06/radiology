Diseases: ['meningioma', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Evaluation of the brain demonstrates bilateralparasagittal right greater than left watershed regions of acuteischemia. This is most evident in the right precentral gyrus correlating with the patients left upper extremity weakness.In addition small vessel ischemic changes are noted in theperiventricular regions. There is bilateral prominence of thesulci and ventricles consistent with atrophy.The intracranial flow voids are maintained. The 8 mm nodular T1and T2 isointense lesion is identified adjacent to the right opticchiasm and may represent a schwannoma or meningioma. Despite thelack of contrast it does not demonstrate signal characteristicsconsistent with an aneurysm. There is however a small leftcavernous ICA aneurysm measuring about 2-3mm (series 7 image 51).Evaluation of the MRA of the circle of Willis does not reveal highgrade stenosis of the anterior or posterior circulation. Thevertebral arteries are codominant.Gradient echo imaging does not reveal susceptibility artifact fromhemorrhage or calcification within the brain parenchyma orextraaxial space.The paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. There is a left mastoideffusion.No abnormality of the orbits is seen.
IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral parasagittal areas of restricted diffusion rightgreater than left suggestive of subacute/acute ischemia likelyperfusional such as from a hypotensive episode given thewatershed distribution.2. Single 8 mm right suprasellar lesion thought to represent aschwannoma or meningioma rather than an aneurysm.3. Probable small cavernous aneurysm left ICA measuring about2-3mm.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
