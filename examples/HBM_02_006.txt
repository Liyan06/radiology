Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Status post right suboccipital/retro-mastoid craniectomy and right cerebellar mass resection with grossly stable appearance of the resection cavity and associated ex vacuo dilatation of the fourth ventricle. Multiple rounded areas of relative T2 hypointensity with surrounding edema possible associated cyst on image numbers 6-11 of series 6 in the right cerebral hemisphere likely represent hemangioblastomas suboptimally evaluated in the absence of intravenous contrast. On image number 12 of series 6 and image number 10 of series 3 there may be a lesion along the left tentorium with mass effect over underlying left cerebellar folia again incompletely evaluated in the absence of intravenous contrast. These fings were better seen on prior enhanced MRI. Right frontal VP shunt catheter in place with unchanged position of its tip and unchanged ventricular size. Multiple prior burr holes with focal areas of underlying gliosis. Multiple areas of encephalomalacia in bilateral cerebral white matter (right worse than left) some of which show evidence of susceptibility on the gradient sequence. Suggestion of gyriform T1 hyperintensity see image number 14 of series 3 likely represent laminar necrosis. Likely right anterior temporal polar arachnoid cyst. No acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift nor mass effect. No diffusion restriction. Visualized paranasal sinuses  mastoid air cells and middle are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute infarction acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage or midline shift. Stable ventricular size. 2. Multiple areas of encephalomalacia in bilateral cerebral hemispheres. 3. Postoperative changes in the posterior fossa suggestion of multiple rounded mass lesions which remain suboptimally evaluated in the absence of intravenous contrast.
