Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There are post-surgical changes related to prior aneurysm clipping with expected small subgaleal collection overlying the left frontotemporal craniotomy small underlying extra-axial collection blood products within the surgical access adjacent areas of T2 prolongation/ cytotoxic edema in the left inferolateral frontal and anterior temporal lobes most likely related to retraction injury and a small hemorrhagic contusion in the left lateral frontal lobe. There are also blood products within bilateral occipital horns and scattered foci of subarachnoid blood in the left middle and anterior cranial fossae. There are scattered foci of restricted diffusion predominantly in the left parietal and to a lesser degree occipital lobes some of which have corresponding emboli with retrograde filling of the distal vessels noted on the recent diagnostic angiogram. There is no midline shift or mass effect. There is stable focal encephalomalacia in the right basal ganglia. There are scattered nonspecific foci of T2 prolongation without associated restricted diffusion most likely related to chronic small vessel ischemia. The appearance of the ventricles and mild deviation of the septum pellucidum to the right are stable. There are changes related to bilateral functional endoscopic sinonasal surgery mild mucosal thickening in inferior aspect of the bilateral maxillary frontal and sphenoid sinuses and ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered embolic infarct in the left parietal and occipital lobes. 2. Postsurgical changes related to left MCA aneurysm clipping as described above.
