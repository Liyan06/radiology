Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There are extensive areas of restricted diffusion with corresponding high flair/T2 signal abnormality involving the cortex bilaterally most prominent in the bilateral frontal lobes bilateral insular cortex and bilateral temporal lobes. Restricted diffusion with corresponding high flair/T2 signal abnormality also involves the bilateral thalami and splenium of the corpus callosum. There is no associated contrast enhancement. Probable more chronic changes of the globus pallidus with atrophy are present bilaterally. There is diffuse effacement of the sulci and basal cisterns with small size of the ventricular system. Findings are in keeping with diffuse cerebral edema. The cerebellar tonsils are at the level of the foramen magnum. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection or midline shift. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. A extensive mucosal disease is present in the visualized paranasal sinuses. There is opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells with extension into the middle ear cavities.
IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse cerebral edema. 2. Restricted diffusion and hyperintense T2/flair signal abnormality involving the bilateral thalami bilateral cerebral cortex most conspicuous in the insular and frontal regions and splenium of the corpus callosum. Although perhaps these findings could be related to acute hepatic encephalopathy the differential diagnosis includes toxic/metabolic etiologies anoxic/hypoxic etiology seizures and Herpes encephalitis. Findings may also be secondary to a combination of etiologies. Extensive involvement of the corpus callosum is of uncertain etiology. Preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. Stephen Kim. Attending interpretation: Agree with above. Findings are felt to primarily represent hypoxic-ischemic etiology. However involvement of the corpus callosum is unusual and of uncertain etiology. Discussed with Dr. Kim.
