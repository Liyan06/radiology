Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is an 8 x 5 mm T2 hyperintense cystic-like lesion in posterior aspect of left temporal lobe. This is associated with surrounding T2-FLAIR hyperintensity. No definite enhancement is noted following contrast demonstration. No restricted diffusion is noted. Findings are more in favor of benign glioma more likely a glioneural tumor such as DNET in the context of cortical dysplasia. There is also a small 6 x 5 mm extra-axial lesion posterior to the cerebellar vermis which demonstrate avid enhancement following contrast administration and can be a small meningioma. There are multiple small foci of T2-FLAIR hyperintensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter nonspecific. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and position. No extraaxial collection. The intracranial flow voids are normal. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted in ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Small nonenhancing cystic-like region in the posterior medial left temporal lobe associated with surrounding T2-FLAIR hyperintensity. Patient has had seizures since the age of 3 per electronic medical records. The imaging findings are not typical of mesial temporal sclerosis as suggested in the outside interpretation. Findings are more in favor of benign process such as cortical dysplasia or a benign low-grade glioneural tumor such as DNET in the context of cortical dysplasia or a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. 2. Subcentimeter enhancing mass along the medial right cerebellum posterior to the vermis without brain edema. This could reflect a meningioma. Comparison with prior studies would be of evaluate ascertain stability. Attention on follow-up imaging is also recommended. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
