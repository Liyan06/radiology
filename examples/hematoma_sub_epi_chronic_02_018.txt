Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Again noted are postsurgical changes of a left-sided craniotomy. There is a relatively stable left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma with mixed signal intensity predominantly subacute hemorrhage. There is a small amount of adjacent left convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is mild associated mass effect with partial compression of the adjacent sulci unchanged. However there is no significant compression of the left lateral ventricle and there is no significant midline shift. The basal cisterns are patent. There are scattered foci of T2 prolongation within the cerebral white matter basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres likely related to chronic ischemic changes. There is no restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. Patchy areas of restriction on the left subdural hematoma correlates to areas of blood products. There is residual pneumocephalus along the anterior left frontal convexity. Following contrast administration there is a small focus of possible enhancement within the left frontal lobe with associated T2 prolongation however there is a small amount of parenchymal blood products at this same location on the sagittal pre-T1-weighted images as well as on prior CT. This is just deep to a burr hole and appears to be post-surgical in nature. There is otherwise no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. The intracranial internal carotid arteries A1 and M1 segments and proximal branches are patent bilaterally. The vertebrobasilar system and proximal branches are patent. There is no visualized aneurysm or focal stenosis.
IMPRESSION:

1. Essentially stable left cerebral convexity subdural hematoma with scattered associated subarachnoid hemorrhage. No midline shift. 2. Chronic ischemic changes. No evidence of acute infarction. 3. Patency of the circle of Willis.
