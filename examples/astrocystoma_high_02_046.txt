Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is a heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in the right thalamus/right midbrain measuring 3.1 cm AP x 3.2 cm TR x 3.6 cm CC. Mild heterogeneity anteriorly within the mass may be related to recent biopsy. There is mass effect on the right aspect of the third ventricle. There is mild surrounding T2/FLAIR signal abnormality extending to the right greater left tectum/periaquaduct region possibly edema or infiltrative tumor. Enhancement markedly worsened; was the patient recently taken off steroid? There is moderate enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles likely obstructive hydrocephalus from compression of the cerebral aqueduct. While stable comparing to the most recent CT this has improved since prior MRI. There is mild periventricular increased T2/FLAIR signal which may represent residual transependymal flow and/or changes from microvascular ischemia; other periventricular and subcortical foci of increased FLAIR signal are likely due to the latter cause. There are bilateral tracts through the frontal lobes from prior right ventriculostomy and left frontal biopsy. Left frontal burr hole. There is mild cytotoxic edema and/or blood products along the left frontal biopsy tract. The extra axialspaces are normal without evidence of mass or blood. The vascular flow voids are unremarkable. The orbits and paranasal sinuses are normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Grossly stable size of a right thalamic/right midbrain enhancing mass likely a high grade glioma with anterior heterogenous portion probably reflecting biopsy site. Marked increase in enhancement; has the patient be taken off steroid recently? 2. Enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles likely moderate obstructive hydrocephalus improved since 12/5/2010. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agree with this report.
