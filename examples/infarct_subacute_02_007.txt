Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There is a focus of restricted diffusion and T2 prolongation within the posterior left frontal lobe near the motor strip. An additional punctate focus is noted more superomedially in the posterior left frontal lobe. These are compatible with acute or early subacute infarctions. No additional areas of restricted diffusion. No abnormal susceptibility on gradient echo imaging. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial fluid collection mass effect or midline shift. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. There is an apparent enlargement at the basilar tip flow void. Although this may just represent the bifurcation a basilar tip aneurysm is not excluded. MRA is recommended. There are mild diffuse paranasal sinus mucosal changes with probable mucus retention cysts in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Left posterior frontal lobe infarctions as above. 2. Apparent enlargement at the basilar tip flow void. Although this may just represent the bifurcation a basilar tip aneurysm is not excluded. MRA is recommended. Dr. Movva was notified of these findings by phone at 7:15 pm on 4/17/2008. Attending note: Agree and have personally reviewed the images. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
