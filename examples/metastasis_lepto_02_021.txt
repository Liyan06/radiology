Diseases: ['metastasis']
FINDINGS:

Cerebral volume remains age-appropriate. No acute intracranial hemorrhage mass-effect midline shift or abnormal foci of magnetic susceptibility. No abnormal diffusion signal to suggest acute to subacute ischemia. Pituitary gland and stalk mildly prominent but otherwise unremarkable. Mild mucosal disease involving ethmoid air cells and opacification of anterior left ethmoid air cell and partial opacification of left sphenoid sinus. Nasal septum deviated to right. Thin linear flair hyperintense dural thickening/lesion with enhancement measuring up to 2 mm again noted along anterior lateral right frontal lobe. Finding not significantly changed from prior. Questionable subtle leptomeningeal enhancement involving inferior bilateral cerebellar hemispheres also grossly unchanged. Diffuse and heterogeneous enhancing lesions throughout visualized calvarium skull base and superior cervical spine consistent with osseous metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:

1. Relatively stable thin linear flair hyperintense dural thickening/lesion with enhancement along anterolateral right frontal lobe. Although not entirely specific in this patient with metastatic breast cancer dural metastasis must be considered. Additional questionable subtle leptomeningeal enhancement involving inferior superficial bilateral cerebellar hemispheres also similar to prior study. Latter finding remains concerning for possible leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Correlate clinically and consider CSF sampling if indicated. 2. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease throughout calvarium skull base and superior cervical spine. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
