Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There is a 3 x 4 mm medially directed aneurysm of the anterior genu of the right cavernous carotid artery. No other intracranial aneurysm is seen. There is tortuosity and irregularity of the remaining cavernous and supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries probably reflecting atherosclerotic changes. There is hypoplasia of the right A2 segment and bihemispheric dominance of the left A2 segment a normal anatomic variant. Otherwise there is patent intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segments. There are no regions of focal stenosis. Redemonstrated is an old right medial orbital wall fracture.
IMPRESSION:

1. No vascular malformation is seen to explain the finding of chronic blood products along the right parietal and occipital sulci but this study does not exclude arteriovenous fistula. Recommend follow-up brain MRI on the same scanner including susceptibility weighted imaging with the addition of IV contrast. 2. 3 x 4 mm medially directed aneurysm of the right cavernous internal carotid artery dolichoectasia bilaterally likely atherosclerotic also evident. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
