Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

There is moderate patient motion artifact particularly on the high-resolution coronal imaging which degrades image quality. Diagnostic information is still obtainable. There are symmetric regions of increased T2 and flair signal of the bilateral corticospinal tracts extending from the corona radiata through the posterior limbs of the internal capsules to the cerebral peduncles. These do not exhibits decreased diffusion or postcontrast enhancement. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Cerebral volume is probably within normal limits for age. There is no pathologic parenchymal enhancement. Evaluation of the temporal lobes demonstrate symmetry in size and signal intensity of the hippocampi and parahippocampal structures. No focal volume loss is identified. Temporal horns are symmetric in size. There is near complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus by mucosal thickening and mucoid material. Mild mucosal thickening of the right greater than left frontal and ethmoid air cells is also present.
IMPRESSION:

1. Symmetric abnormal signal of the bilateral corticospinal tracts as above. The etiology of this finding is not clear from the present examination however can be seen in the setting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Other possibilities include normal variance toxic exposure metabolic disease Wallerian degeneration or less likely other demyelinating disease. Correlation with the patient's neurologic exam and history of toxic/metabolic exposure as well as follow-up are recommended. 2. Near-complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with mild mucosal thickening of the right greater than left paranasal sinuses. These findings were discussed with and confirmed by Dr. Katona on January 31 2010 at 12:39.
