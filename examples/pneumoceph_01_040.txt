Diseases: ['pneumocephalus']
FINDINGS:

The study is significantly motion degraded despite sedation. There has been interval right-sided craniotomy and resection of the right anterior temporal lobe. There are associated blood products within the surgical cavity and extra-axial blood products along the right cerebral convexity. There are expected postsurgical changes of the overlying scalp including edema and air. A few foci of low signal are present within the surgical cavity likely representing foci of pneumocephalus or susceptiblity from surgery. One focus measuring 8 mm directly apposes a branch of the right middle cerebral artery. Pseudoaneurysm cannot be excluded at this location although the lack of enhancement argues against this. Mild mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. No significant mildine shift. There is restricted diffusion at the margin of the surgical cavity as well as along the described areas of blood products. Again noted are areas of T2 prolongation involving the left basal ganglia and left thalamus as well as along the ventral left surface of the pons as noted on previous MRI. The previously noted enhancement in the left basal ganglia as well as the left third and fifth cranial nerves and the right seventh and eighth cranial nerves is less well appreciated. Mild paranasal sinus mucosal changes.
IMPRESSION:

1. Significantly motion degraded study. Repeat study recommended. 2. Post-surgical changes of right anterior temporal lobe surgery. Foci of susceptibility within the cavity are likely foci of pneumocephalus or due to the surgery. Less likely consideration for one focus is pseudoaneurysm. See discussion above. 3. Persistent abnormal signal in left basal ganglia and thalamus. Previously noted enhancement and cranial nerve enhancement less appreciated due to motion. Dr. Halper notified of these findings by phone at approximately 12:00 pm on 1/24/2009.
