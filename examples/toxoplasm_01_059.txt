Diseases: ['toxoplasmosis', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and moderately prominent similar to prior CT and more distant CT September 9 2010 as well. There is a thin rim of increased intensity on the body's lateral ventricles but not around temporal horns such that if this is hydrocephalus it is compensated. Ventricular prominence is out of proportion to cisterns and sulci but these are also prominent. Right Ommaya catheter redemonstrated better seen on comparison CT. Also redemonstrated are encephalomalacic areas left parietal lobe which are probably stable possibly old ischemic foci. However on diffusion-weighted images there are small effusion-bright foci with slightly decreased diffusion coefficient right corona radiata left and possibly right pons all of which are very small area no midline shift or mass effect no defined collection or enhancing mass. Additional diffusion-bright foci are seen in centrum semiovale bilaterally but these are less convincing and may represent shine through. Small diffusion-bright foci do not enhance. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified.
IMPRESSION:

1. Motion degraded study remarkable for small foci of minimally decreased diffusion right corona radiata left and possibly right pons too small to characterize but not enhancing. These may represent small ischemic foci correlate for proximal source as these cross vascular territories. Infection such as toxoplasmosis but excluded doubt PML or neoplasm with this pattern. No enhancing masses collections or mass effect. Recommend follow up correlate with CSF sampling as indicated. 2. Encephalomalacic foci left parietal lobe which remain stable compared to CT studies in September and November of 2010 suspect old ischemic foci. 3. Right sided Ommaya catheter lateral and third ventricular prominence out of portion to sulci and cisterns may represent compensated hydrocephalus and/or central volume loss but stable.
