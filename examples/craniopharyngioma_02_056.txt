Diseases: ['craniopharyngioma']
FINDINGS:

No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. There are no extra-axial fluid collections or mass-effect. There are scattered foci of increased T2 and flair signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter not significantly changed since the prior study likely representing sequelae from chronic small vessel ischemic change. The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent for age not significantly changed since the prior study possibly reflective of the patient's known early onset Alzheimer's disease. Again seen is a 3 mm suprasellar focus of T1 hyperintensity which is located anterior to the lower aspect of the infundibular stalk similar in appearance to the prior study. There is no mass effect the adjacent structures. It is difficult to assess for enhancement due to the intrinsic T1 shortening. There is no definite evidence of signal drop out on fat-saturated sequences to suggest fat containing lesions such as a lipoma. There is no definite connection to adjacent vessels to suggest an aneurysm. Favored differential considerations continue to include a Rathke cyst or a craniopharyngioma among others with fat containing neoplams less likely. The orbits are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable 3-mm T1 hyperintense suprasellar focus anterior to the infundibular stalk favored to represent a Rathke cleft cyst or craniopharyngioma. 2. No acute intracranial findings.
