Diseases: ['hematoma', 'aneurysm', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and sulci are appropriate for age. No abnormal restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. There are scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the bilateral cerebral white matter nonspecific. They are stable in appearance compared to 6/11/09. Gradient echo images show no significant intracranial blood product deposition. With contrast there is no abnormal enhancement. MRA head: The previously questioned aneurysm vs. infundibulum of the right ICA is still not well seen. There is a questionable new stenosis or filling defect at the right proximal A1 vs. artifact. MRA neck: The gadolinium-enhanced images are degraded by early acquisition. There is improved appearance of the left ICA dissection at the skull base with little if any residual stenosis. There is a focus of hyperintensity posterior to the left ICA at its precavernous segment. Fat-sat images show a small focus of hyperintensity in this area. TOF images do not show abnormal flow to suggest a pseudoaneurysm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval healing of left ICA dissection at the skull base. 2. There is an abnormality at the precavernous segment of the left ICA of uncertain significance. It may represent an artifact or perhaps a mural hematoma. Doubt but cannot completely exclude pseudoaneurysm. As warranted repeat gadolinium-enhanced MRA or CTA may be performed. 3. Questionable new stenosis or embolus at right proximal A1 vs artifact. Clinical correlation advised. 4. The right intracranial ICA aneurysm vs. infundibulum is not seen on today's study. It may represent an infundibulum or perhaps a stable small aneurysm. 5. Nonspecific signal changes in the brain stable. Findings discussed with Dr. Messe of neurology at 3:18 pm on 9/29/09.
