Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Numerous foci of nonspecific T2 prolongation in the periventricular subcortical and deep white matter. Mild parenchymal atrophy. Patent basilar cisterns. No abnormal intracranial collection mass effect cytotoxic edema or hemorrhage. Normal orbits calvarial marrow and intracranial flow voids. Prominent pituitary gland. Severe cervical degenerative disease including disc protrusion at C3-C4 causing moderate canal stenosis left lateral disc protrusion at C4-C5 causing mild canal stenosis and mild left foraminal stenosis right lateral disc protrusion at C5-C6 causing mild canal stenosis and moderate right foraminal stenosis and central disc protrusion at C6-C7 causing mild canal stenosis. T2 hyperintense lesions at C4-C5 (left) C5-C6 (right). Cord signal abnormality at T6-T7 and T9. Lateral wedge deformity at T7 apex of severe levoscoliosis. T1- and T2- hyperintense material in the right aspect of the spinal canal at between T5 and T9. No abnormal enhancement.
IMPRESSION:

1. There is nonspecific white matter signal abnormality in the brain. In the appropriate clinical setting these findings are consistent with demyelination. There is no abnormal enhancement. 2. There are several lesions in the cervical spine that are likely due to demyelination but superimposed myelomalacia from chronic cervical degenerative disease is not excluded. 3. In the thoracic spine there is severe levoscoliosis. There is material in the spinal canal of uncertain origin. It probably represents displaced epidural fat but if there is clinical suspicion of acute hematoma then fat-suppressed T1-weighted images should be obtained. Prior imaging would be very useful if it is available. There is a demyelinating lesion at T9 and there is a lesion at T6-T7 that is probably due to demyelination but as in the cervical spine a degenerative or traumatic etiology cannot be excluded.
