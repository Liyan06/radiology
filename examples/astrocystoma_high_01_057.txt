Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Examination degraded by patient motion artifact but overall remains diagnostic. Stable postsurgical changes related to right frontal craniotomy and stable resection cavity in medial right frontal lobe. Mild T2 prolongation along inferior superior and posterolateral margins of surgical resection cavity grossly stable. No surrounding nodular enhancement. Cerebral volume age appropriate. Stable foci of T2 prolongation in right parietal lobe periventricular white matter. No abnormal diffusion restriction or abnormal foci of magnetic susceptibility. No acute intracranial hemorrhage extra-axial fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. Otherwise no evidence of abnormal intracranial enhancement. Interval worsening of paranasal sinus inflammatory disease including moderate mucosal thickening involving maxillary and sphenoid sinuses right sphenoid sinus retention cyst and mild ethmoid air cell mucosal thickening. Stable nasal septum perforation. Mild irregularity and narrowing involving distal right intracranial vertebral artery just proximal to vertebrobasilar junction. Mild focal stenosis at this location not excluded. A right A1 arterial segment not identified with bilateral A2 arterial segments appearing to arise from left A1 arterial segment/anterior communicating artery. Small 2-mm outpouching arising from proximal right A2 arterial segment likely at origin of small branch vessel. Finding likely represents small infundibulum although small 2-mm aneurysm at this location not excluded. Otherwise no evidence for focal high-grade intracranial arterial stenosis or intracranial aneurysm. Please note that MRA may be less sensitive in detecting aneurysms measuring less than 4 mm.
IMPRESSION:

1. Postsurgical changes related to right frontal craniotomy and right frontal neoplasm resection with stable mild signal abnormality surrounding surgical cavity. 2. Stable nonspecific nonenhancing foci of signal abnormality in right parietal periventricular white matter. 3. Mild irregularity and narrowing involving distal right vertebral artery just proximal to vertebrobasilar junction. Mild focal stenosis at this location not excluded. 4. Small outpouching involving proximal right A2 arterial segment at apparent origin of small branch vessel. Finding likely represents infundibulum although small 2-mm aneurysm at this location not excluded. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
