FINDINGS:

There is interval continued evolution of the left temporal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma which has decreased in size now with more encephalomalacic appearance and minimal ex vacuo dilatation left temporal horn. Previously noted left subdural collection has resolved. No new areas of infarction or hemorrhage. Stable generalized cerebral volume loss is age appropriate. Stable moderate periventricular deep and subcortical white matter T2 and flair signal abnormality lesions are nonspecific but likely representing chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There are no convincing areas of abnormal enhancement. On gradient echo images there are multiple small foci of decreased intensity in both hemispheres all above the tentorium. There is partial opacification of the ethmoid sinus. Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the frontal maxillary and ethmoid sinuses with polyps/mucus retention cysts in the right maxillary antrum and left nasal pharynx. No osseous abnormalities are seen. To the extent that they may be evaluated with routine MR imaging the vascular structures have a normal appearance except for mild dolichoectasia.
IMPRESSION:

1. Appropriate continued evolution of left temporal intraparenchymal hematoma with associated encephalomalacia. No acute infarction new intracranial hemorrhage mass effect or midline shift. 2. Tiny foci of decreased intensity above the tentorium throughout both cerebral hemispheres on gradient echo images. These represent old microbleeds associated with hypertensive/chronic subcortical small vessel ischemic changes but amyloid angiopathy could cause this appearance and be a source for original temporal hematoma. 3. Stable probable sequelae of small vessel ischemia.
