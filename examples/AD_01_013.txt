Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Hippocampi are normal and internal signal and architecture and symmetric bilaterally. Tiny choroid fissure cysts are incidentally noted on both sides. There is global volume loss above and below the tentorium without preferential volume loss in any particular region. Normal pattern of mineral deposition. Normal intracranial flow voids are present. T2 prolongation in the white matter primarily periventricular is nonspecific and most likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes in this age group and not greater than expected for age. There is an extra-axial mass in the left middle cranial fossa adjacent to the temporal bone which most likely represents a meningioma this could be confirmed with contrast enhanced imaging. Peripheral low signal on T2 may represent calcification. The mass measures 1.4 x 1.1 cm. No significant mass-effect. There is no intracranial hemorrhage acute infarct and or extra-axial fluid collection. The orbits are normal. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Marrow signal in the calvarium and skull base is normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Nonspecific global volume loss within expected range for age and not preferential in any particular region. Nonspecific T2 prolongation in the white matter is also not unexpected for age and most likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 2. Small extra-axial mass in the left middle cranial fossa adjacent to the temporal bone most likely representing a meningioma. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation
