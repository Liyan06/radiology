Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Multiple foci of increased signal intensity within the deep and periventricular white matter the subcortical white matter in the largest one located in the left parieto-occipital region. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. On image 14 of series 4 there is a midline region of prominent signal void measuring approximately 3 mm this sits just below the anterior communicating artery raising the possibility of a small aneurysm. Further evaluation with CTA or MRA is recommended. There is mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary anterior ethmoidal and frontal sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple subcortical and periventricular white matter lesions visualized as above. These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a spectrum of vascular and inflammatory processes including demyelination and clinical correlation is advised. Intravenous contrast was not administered per physician request. 2. Mild prominence of the adenoids for age clinically correlate. Directly visualize. 3. On image 14 of series 4 there is a midline region of prominent signal void measuring approximately 3 mm this sits just below the anterior communicating artery raising the possibility of a small aneurysm. Further evaluation with CTA or MRA is recommended.
