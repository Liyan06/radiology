Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

The study is limited by motion artifacts more so MRA sequence. There is no intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is no restricted diffusion. There are nonspecific punctate foci of T2 prolongation within the bilateral white matter. The ventricular system is unremarkable. MR angiography demonstrates nonvisualization of the right internal carotid artery from its origin to its proximal cavernous segment. There is a prominent intercavernous collateral supplying the proximal right cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery. The right cavernous and supraclinoid ICA as well as the right MCA and ACA are asymmetrically decreased in size. There is a small left posterior communicating artery. The right posterior communicating artery is not visualized. Vertebrobasilar system is patent without evidence for stenosis. There is focal protrusion of the posterior aspect of the proximal left cavernous ICA with broad base measuring approximately 3mm x 4 mm worrisome for an aneurysm.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial abnormality. Nonspecific foci of T2 prolongation within bilateral white matter compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 2. Please note that contrast was not administered as per the request of the ordering physician. Therefore evaluation for enhancement related to inflammatory processes such as sarcoid is limited. 3. Congenital absence of the right internal carotid artery with intercavernous cross collateralization supplying the proximal right cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery. There is asymmetric decrease in size of the right cavernous and supraclinoid ICA as well as the right MCA and ACA. 4. Focal broad based outpouching of the posterior aspect of the left proximal cavernous internal carotid artery worrisome for aneurysm. Follow-up is recommended either with CTA MRA or conventional angiogram.
