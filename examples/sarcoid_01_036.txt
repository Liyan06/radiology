Diseases: ['sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

Evaluation of the brain shows a large area of T2 hyperintensityinvolving the pons and left middle cerebellar peduncle with slightinvolvement of the right middle cerebellar peduncle as well. Noother areas of parenchymal signal abnormality are identified.Cerebral ventricles cortical sulci and basilar cisterns areunremarkable.Evaluation of the cervical and thoracic spine shows normalvertebral body alignment. There are findings of mild degenerativedisc disease. At C5-6 a broad based left paracentral protrusioneffaces the left ventral subarachnoid space though it does notcompress the cord. Small posterior disc protrusion is evidentthat he 5-6 without cord compression. There are no areas of cordsignal abnormality.
IMPRESSION:

1. Area signal abnormality within the pons and middle cerebellarpeduncles left greater than right. The patient refusedgadolinium administration and thus the lesion is not fullycharacterized. This lesion may represent demyelinating disease(ADEM or MS). Other infectious/inflammatory etiologies such asLyme disease and sarcoidosis are differential considerations.Disorders such as Behcets vasculitis and Whipples disease arealso less likely differential considerations. Neoplasm is notexcluded. If the patient is willing gadolinium enhanced imagingis advised.2. Degenerative changes in the cervical and thoracic spinewithout cord compression or cord signal abnormalities.Findings discussed with Dr. Markowitz at 11:45 AM on 5-25-04.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
