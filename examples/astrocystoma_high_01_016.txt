Diseases: ['glioblastoma', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Images demonstrate a large mass involving the body and genu of the corpus callosum extending into the bilateral frontal lobe white matter. There is irregular rim and nodular enhancement of the mass with a central nonenhancing portion consistent with central necrosis. On the flair images there is white matter change extending beyond the regions of enhancement into the bilateral frontal lobe white matter consistent with edema and tumor infiltration. There is enhancement of the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricle anterior horns and foramina of Monro extending bilaterally to the ventricular body and to the lateral atrium of the left lateral ventricle. There is moderate prominence of the lateral ventricles consistent with hydrocephalus likely obstructive. No other abnormal enhancing lesions are identified. There is atelectasis and opacification of the right maxillary sinus consistent with silent sinus. The remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The calvarium is unremarkable. The superficial soft tissues and orbits are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:

1. Large infiltrating enhancing mass of the anterior body and genu of the corpus callosum extending to the bilateral frontal lobe white matter as detailed above with likely central necrosis. Interventricular extension to the lateral ventricles as detailed above. The findings are most consistent with a high-grade tumor such as glioblastoma. 2. Moderately enlarged lateral ventricles likely obstructive hydrocephalus. 3. Findings consistent with right maxillary silent sinus. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST ADDITION: I agree with the preliminary report with the following additions: I am uncertain whether the right maxillary sinus findings represent an atelectatic sinus or just a hypoplastic sinus. clinical correlation is advised.
