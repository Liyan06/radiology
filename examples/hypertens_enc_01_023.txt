Diseases: ['amyloid']
FINDINGS:

There are new foci of restricted diffusion within the right occipital optic radiations and posterior limb of the right lateral thalamus compatible with acute infarcts. There is also new focus of T2 prolongation within the left peritrigonal white matter best seen on image 16 series 6 without mild associated diffusion restriction. There are multiple confluent stable foci of T2 prolongation with associated encephalomalacia most likely related to microangiopathic changes. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is stable volume loss with associated changes in the ventricles and subarachnoid spaces in the low in the low year. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. The scattered pinpoint foci of susceptibility in the deep and subcortical white matter are stable. The gland by hippocampal structures are bilaterally symmetric and demonstrate no evidence of asymmetric volume loss or abnormal signal. There is minimal bilateral maxillary sinus and right ethmoid air cells mucosal thickening. Small amount of fluid in the left mastoid air cells. The right mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. New foci of acute infarcts within the right greater than left posterior circulation distribution as above. CT angiogram could be used for further evaluation. 2. Nonspecific bilateral foci of susceptibility most likely related to hypertensive microhemorrhage and less likely amyloid angiopathy. Extensive microangiopathic changes. The above findings were reported to and acknowledged to Ms. Meryl Candor assistant to Dr. Edward Cooper who was out of country at 3:55 p.m. 07/31/2009.
