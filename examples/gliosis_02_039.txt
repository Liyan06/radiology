Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Right parietal burr hole is noted with minimal gliosis in the right frontal lobe likely from prior shunt placement. Slightly prominent ventricles as compared to the prior CT from August 28 2011 but unchanged from prior May 27 2011 MRI. Patient is status post resection of left planum sphenoidale encephalocele with expected interval evolution of previously described postoperative changes in the left posterior/ superior nasal cavity left ethmoid and maxillary sinuses with mild mucosal thickening and enhancement. There is associated distortion encephalomalacia and signal normality involving inferior left frontal lobe extending into the genu of the corpus callosum with stable distortion of left frontal horn. No interval focus of restricted diffusion is noted to suggest acute infarction. No interval acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage or extracerebral fluid collections are identified. Faint T1 hyperintensity in the right thalamus likely from residual blood products. No surrounding vasogenic edema or mass-effect. Mild periventricular T2/flair prolongation is nonspecific. Following contrast administration no pathologic parenchymal or meningeal enhancement. Stable appearance of lipoma in subcutaneous tissues anterior to right parotid gland. Mucosal changes involving left frontal ethmoidal recess left ethmoid air cells and left maxillary sinus. The small amount of fluid is seen in the left more than right mastoids.
IMPRESSION:

1. Patient is status post resection of left planum sphenoidale encephalocele with expected interval evolution of previously described postoperative changes in the left posterior/ superior nasal cavity left ethmoid and maxillary sinuses with associated encephalomalacia and signal abnormality in the left inferior frontal lobe extending to the genu of the corpus callosum. 2. No interval acute intracranial findings.
