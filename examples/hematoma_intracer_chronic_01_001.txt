FINDINGS:

There is interval marked decrease in the size of the right frontal parenchymal hematoma. There is now minimal residual that has predominately hemosiderin susceptibility. No enhancement is again noted with this focus. Redemonstrated is a rounded dural based mass attached to the posterior falx in the right occipital lobe with T2 and T1 dark likely calcified center and enhancing rim measuring approximately 20mm in diameter with no signal abnormality in the underlying brain. Additional smaller 8 mm enhancing lesion is noted along the left lesser wing of sphenoid bone/ anterior clinoid proccess (series 5 image 14) likely additional smaller meningioma. Redemonstrated are prominent calcifications along the anterior falx. Redemonstrated is focal area of T1 shortening in the left supra-cerebellar cistern consistent with a intracranial midline lipoma. Extensive scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity along the deep periventricular and subcortical white matter nonspecific but are likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic changes unchanged. Moderate age-appropriate cerebral volume loss is noted. The calvarium is normal. The orbits are normal. Minimal mucosal thickening along the ethmoid air cells and small retention cysts in the left maxillary sinuses. Few nonenhancing rounded lesions within the occipital scalp likely sebaceous cysts.
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving right frontal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma with minimal residual that contains chronic blood product / hemosiderin and marked improvement/resolution of the surrounding vasogenic edema. 2. Stable right occipital meningioma and probable smaller left anterior clinoid process meningioma as well as midline lipoma within the posterior fossa.
