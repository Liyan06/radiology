FINDINGS:

There is a 39 x 28 by 40 mm extra-axial right temporal lesion causing mass effect and vasogenic edema on the adjacent right temporal and frontal lobes without significant midline shift. This lesion is isointense to gray matter on T1 weighted images and mildly heterogeneous but predominantly isointense to gray matter on T2 images. There is associated hyperostosis of the inner table of the squamosal temporal bone. There is minimal parenchymal increased intensity following white matter adjacent to and especially posterior to the mass suggestive of vasogenic edema. Following contrast administration there is avid enhancement with some central heterogeneity and a dural tail slight nodularity along the medial surface. There is minimal branching linear enhancement right parietal lobe peripherally likely small developmental venous anomaly. There are scattered hyperintensities on long-TR images in the deep and subcortical white matter nonspecific but most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes number of hyperintensities in excess of that expected for stated age of 50. There is no restricted diffusion. There is no acute transcortical infarct. Flow voids are maintained. Relative cerebral blood volume markedly increased in the mass spectroscopy is abnormal but non-contributory given preceding findings. These findings do not change initial impression of meningioma on structural imaging.
IMPRESSION:

1. Extra-axial mass most consistent with meningioma right temporal region with associated underlying hyperostosis likely present. Other possibilities include atypical meningioma and hemangiopericytoma less likely metastasis unless known primary cancer. 2. Probable chronic small vessel ischemic changes deep and subcortical white matter.
