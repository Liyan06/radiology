Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Comparison is made with 6/13/2001 exam.There is a T1-bright primarily T2-bright (with some areas ofdecreased intensity) extraaxial collection over the right convexitycompatible with small-to-moderate sized subdural hematoma. There isevidence of dural thickening and enhancement. There is minimaleffacement of the right lateral ventricle and minimal midline shift tothe left as well as sulcal effacement over the right convexity.Basal cisterns remain patent. This has appeared since the previousstudy.Again noted are multiple hyperintensities on long-TR images in theperiventricular and subcortical white matter as well as deep whitematter tracts and corpus callosum. Some of these are orientedperpendicular to the ventricular margin in the corpus callosum suspicious for demyelinating plaques. However they are stablecompared to the previous exam. None of the hyperintensities showenhancement on post contrast images.
IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate sized right subdural hematoma with minimal mass effectover right convexity as described above with mixed signal intensityand enhancement of dura suggestive of subacute to chronic timing.According to patient's husband (a physician) the patient fellapproximately two months ago. Correlate clinically recommendfollow-up to insure stability/resolution. Dr. Greco's office wascontacted but Dr. Greco was unavailable at that time. Findings werediscussed with Dr. Kessler at the time of the exam.2. Stable hyperintensities on long-TR images and periventricular anddeep white matter as described above stable in appearance consistentwith history of multiple sclerosis.Transcribed by: Interface MedspeakLast Edited by: WOLF RONALD L MD
