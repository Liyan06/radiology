Diseases: ['neurocytoma']
FINDINGS:

Susceptibility artifact from right posterior approach ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter degrades examination limiting evaluation of the adjacent brain parenchyma. The patient is again noted to be status post right craniotomy for resection of central neurocytoma. There is partial visualization of the right posterior parietal approach ventriculostomy catheter with its distal tip visualized near the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle. On the sagittal T1-weighted sequence there has been significant decrease in caliber of the third ventricle and the visualized lateral ventricles compared to the prior MRI examination dated 6/6/2013. Ventricular size however is similar to that seen on more recent head CT dated 8/18/2013 given differences in technique and limited examination. Cerebellar tonsils protrude approximately 7-8 mm below the foramen magnum  consistent with Chiari malformation similar to the prior study.
IMPRESSION:

1. Incomplete examination as only sagittal T1 weighted sequence was performed. The examination was terminated early as the patient became claustrophobic and was unable to tolerate the study. 2. Status post right craniotomy for resection of central neurocytoma with postoperative sequelae. The current study is insufficient to assess for residual or recurrent neoplasm. 3. Chiari 1 malformation. 4. Interval decrease in the visualized third and lateral ventricles compared to prior examination dated 6/6/2013. This is similar to head CT dated 8/18/2013 given differences in technique and limited examination. 5. Programmable shunt catheter needs to be re interrogated following MRI. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
