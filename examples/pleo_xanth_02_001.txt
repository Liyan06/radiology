Diseases: ['astrocytoma']
FINDINGS:

There is an ovoid 7 x 10 mm well-circumscribed mass in the left temporal lobe as seen on the prior CT. The central portion of the lesion follows CSF on all sequences with the exception of a small focal somewhat linear structure centrally. There is a nodular incomplete rim of enhancement with extensive vasogenic edema surrounding the lesion. Edema causes mild mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma. No restricted diffusion. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Small punctate foci of T2 prolongation in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the right frontal horn are nonspecific likely unrelated to temporal lobe mass (image 15 series 7). The cerebral volume is otherwise appropriate for the patient's stated age. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Ovoid cystic mass with rim enhancement and surrounding vasogenic edema within the left temporal lobe as above. The imaging findings are nonspecific however neurocysticercosis is favored given that the contents follow CSF on all sequences the presence of a curvilinear structure centrally suggestive of a scolex and the presence of surrounding vasogenic edema. Other lesions including low-grade neoplasm such as pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma pilocytic astrocytoma or ganglioglioma could have a similar appearance. Follow-up imaging in approximately 1 month or sooner if clinically indicated is recommended. 2. Small punctate foci of T2 prolongation in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the right frontal horn are nonspecific but likely unrelated to temporal lobe mass Findings and recommendations discussed with Dr. Khella at the time of interpretation on 4/28/10 I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agree with this report.
