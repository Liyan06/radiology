Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Redemonstration of postsurgical change with cystic encephalomalacia and surrounding gliosis in the right temporal lobe and encephalomalacia with gliosis in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Right frontal approach ventricular shunt with tip in the foramen of Monro with slight decrease in associated FLAIR hyperintensity noted along the course of the catheter representing edema. Interval resolution of intraventricular blood. Stable appearance of DWI and T2 hyperintense mass in the right prepontine cistern with mass effect on the pons and leftward displacement of the basilar artery. Focal FLAIR hyperintensity in the right corona radiata which is new since CT of the head from 5/21/13 most likely representing evolving subacute/chronic vascular insult. Surrounding rim of diffusion hyperintensity and faint peripheral hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. No susceptibility on the gradient sequence to suggest frank hemorrhage. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections. Scattered foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter representing sequela small vessel ischemic change. No midline shift. Interval decrease in size of ventricles. The ventricles and sulci are symmetric and age-appropriate in size. Mucosal retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of encephalomalacia in the right temporal lobe and right cerebellar hemisphere. 2. Stable residual epidermoid cyst. 3. Focal FLAIR hyperintensity in the right corona radiata which is new since CT of the head from 5/21/13 most likely representing evolving subacute/chronic vascular insult. No susceptibility on the gradient sequence to suggest frank hemorrhage. Advise clinical correlation. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
