FINDINGS:

Interval marked enlargement of left paramedian parietal lobe enhancing mass measuring 2.3 cm AP by 1.6 cm transverse in series 8 image 18 just posterior to the splenium. Surrounding nonenhancing T2 hyperintensity extending to the left occiput posterior left frontal lobe posterior left temporal lobe caudate tail and posterior corona radiata and crossing midline through the splenium likely represents surrounding vasogenic edema or less likely post therapeutic changes. This results in moderate local mass effect with effacement of the left atrium and occipital horn. No midline shift. This mass shows faint diffusion hyperintensity. Stable nonenhancing focus of T2 hyperintensity involving the right occipital cortex and subcortical white matter likely representing posttreatment change. Expected evolution of postsurgical changes of right parietotemporal craniotomy with right temporal resection cavity. Stable thickening and enhancement of the dura underlying the craniotomy. Stable thin extra-axial fluid collection beneath the craniotomy. Chronic blood products present within the resection cavity. Stable nodular enhancement about the margins of the resection cavity likely postsurgical but presence of residual neoplasm is not excluded. Edema about the resection cavity appears improved. Stable diffuse low signal within the bone marrow particularly at the skull base and upper cervical spine likely due to marrow reconversion. Left maxillary sinus retention cysts. Orbits grossly normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval growth of medial left parietal lobe enhancing mass with extensive surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in keeping with lymphoma progression. 2. Right temporal lobe resection cavity with probable post-surgical enhancement although residual neoplasm is not excluded.
