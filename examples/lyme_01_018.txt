Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

There has been no significant change since prior study. There arebilateral nonenhancing foci of signal abnormality in the whitematter without edema or mass effect. These findings arenonspecific differential may include: Lyme disease migraine sarcoid multiple sclerosis and small vessel ischemic changes.The cerebral ventricles cortical sulci and basal cisterns areunremarkable. There is no midline shift or herniation. There isno intra or extra axial fluid collections. There is no pathologicenhancement. The orbits are unremarkable. The paranasal sinusesare clear.The pituitary gland is normal in size signal intensity andenhancement pattern. Pituitary stalk is midline. There is astable 7 mm pineal gland cyst.
IMPRESSION:

1. No change since prior study with multiple bilateral whitematter signal abnormality. Please see comments.2. The pituitary gland is normal in size signal intensity andenhancement pattern.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: Interface TalkStation
