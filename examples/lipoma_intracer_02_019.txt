Diseases: ['lipoma']
FINDINGS:

No prior. Correlation was done to noncontrast CT maxillofacial dated April 6 2009. As demonstrated on the CT head there is a 5.2 x 4.8 x 5.6 cm (AP transverse and craniocaudal dimensions) fat-containing lesion in the superficial left parotid gland with very thin internal septation and no enhancing nodule consistent with a lipoma. Bilateral facial nerves from the stylomastoid foramen to the internal auditory canal are unremarkable. The brain stem and cerebellapontine angles are unremarkable. Evaluation of the aerodigestive tract demonstrates no exophytic mass nor areas of focal mass effect. Evaluation of the cervical lymph chains demonstrate two lymphadenopathy in bilateral level II measuring 1.8 cm on the right and 2.4 cm on the left. There are scattered posteior triangle retropharyngeal and the cervical lymph nodes not pathologic by imaging criteria. There is prominent lymphoid tissue of the Waldeyer' ring. Nonspecific 6 mm T2 hyperintensity nodule is seen in the left thyroid gland. The visualized salivary glands are unremarkable in appearance. Mucous retention cyst in bilateral maxillary sinuses. Complete opacification of the right mastoid air cell. The marrow signal intensity of the cervical spine and visualized skull base and mandible is normal.
IMPRESSION:

1. Large lipoma within the superficial left parotid gland. 2. Two lymphadenopathy at bilateral level II and prominent Waldeyer's ring lymphoid tissue are nonspecific probably reactive. Clinical correlation is recommended. 3. Unremarkable intracranial courses of bilateral facial nerves. 4. Nonspecific 6 mm left thyroid nodule. Attending interpretation: Overall agree with above report. No definite pathologic lymphadenopathy. Bilateral level II nodes mentioned above are less than 1.5 cm in short axis and greater than 2:1 ratio in long:short axis.
