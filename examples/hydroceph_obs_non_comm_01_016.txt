Diseases: ['hemangioblastoma']
FINDINGS:

The patient is status post bilateral suboccipital craniectomy. metallic artifact is seen adjacent to the right hypoglossal canal and at the craniectomy site. There has been interval progression of disease. There is a large predominately cystic mass in the right cerebellum with an enhancing peripheral nodule measuring 4.7 x 5.5 cm that causes mass effect on the brainstem and compresses the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct. There is mild increase in size of the lateral and third ventricles. No transependymal egress of CSF. A similar smaller lesion is posterior to the index lesion in the right cerebellum that has also increased in size. There are multiple solidly enhancing lesions in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres medulla and the left parahippocampal gyrus. while these lesions appear similar in number most have increased in size. Diffusion weighted images are negative for restricted diffusion. No evidence of acute infarction. The orbits are grossly normal. Mild mucosal changes are seen in ethmoid air cells and bilateral maxillary sinuses. A mucus retention cyst is in the right maxillary sinus. Mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval development of two predominately cystic masses with a peripherally based solid enhancing nodule in the right cerebellum consistent with hemangioblastoma in this patient with von Hippau Lindau syndrome. There is mass effect on the brainstem fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct. There is mild upward herniation of the cerebellum. Mild interval increase in size of the lateral and third ventricles.2. Again seen are multiple solidly enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa and in the left parahippocampal gyrus which have increased in size.Attending review: I agree with the above.
