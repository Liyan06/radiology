Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

Prior brain MRI dated November 15 2011. There has been continued evolution of the left periventricular intraparenchymal hematoma with contraction of the hematoma cavity and continued decrease in local mass-effect. There is no abnormal enhancement to suggest an underlying lesion. A second punctate focus of susceptibility is noted along the right putamen in keeping with a remote microhemorrhage. There is stable mild fullness and T2 prolongation of the left caudate head. There is no associated enhancement. MR perfusion demonstrates a lack of elevated cerebral blood volume in this region. There is no abnormal increased permeability. There is redemonstration of nonspecific foci of T2 prolongation within the bilateral white matter and brainstem. Ventricles and CSF spaces are age-appropriate. Intraventricular hemorrhage has cleared. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are identified. Partially empty sella is again noted. There is persistent decrease in bone marrow signal of the upper cervical spine nonspecific but stable. Paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Continued evolution of the left periventricular intraparenchymal hematoma. 2. Stable mild enlargement and T2 prolongation of the left caudate head. There is no elevated cerebral blood volume or permeability in this region. Increasing interval follow up in approximately 6 months or as clinically indicated may be obtained to ensure stability. 3. Persistent but stable decrease in bone marrow signal of the upper cervical spine nonspecific. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
