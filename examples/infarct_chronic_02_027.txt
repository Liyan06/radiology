Diseases: ['infarction']
FINDINGS:

There is restricted diffusion within the right midbrain consistent with acute infarction within the right posterior cerebral artery territory. Additional several small foci of restricted diffusion within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis likely embolic. There is hemorrhage layering in the bilateral occipital horns. There is FLAIR hyperintensity in the bilateral subarachnoid spaces and basilar cisterns in the cerebral hemispheres consistent with the known diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. The thalami appear swollen and abnormal in signal similar to the most recent CT exams but more more prominent than the initial MRI 5/4/12. Multiple foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the bilateral periventricular and deep white matter likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Right frontal approach shunt terminating in the right lateral ventricle. The ventricles are prominent and enlarged compared to the prior MRI however not significantly changed from the most recent CT.
IMPRESSION:

1. Restricted diffusion within the right midbrain consistent with acute infarction within the right posterior cerebral artery territory. 2. Additional several small foci of restricted diffusion within the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis likely embolic. Range. The Diffuse subarachnoid blood in the cerebral hemispheres and cisterns. 4. Intraventricular blood with prominence of the ventricles. 5. Thalami appear swollen and abnormal in signal likely edematous similar to the most recent CT exams but more more prominent than the initial MRI 5/4/12.
