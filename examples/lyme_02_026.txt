Numerous foci of T2 hyperintensity are seen in the subcorticalwhite matter within the centrum semi ovale bilaterally. Inaddition there is also a focus of T2 hyperintensity in the rightanterior external capsule. None of these lesions enhance.No extra axial fluid collections midline shift mass effect. Nohydrocephalus.The hippocampi demonstrate no areas of abnormal signal.Incidental note is made of a prominent perivascular space on theright.

There are mild mucosal changesin the right sphenoid sinus. The remainder of the paranasalsinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
