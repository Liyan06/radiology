Diseases: ['empyema']
FINDINGS:

There is a right frontal external ventricular drain seen terminating near the foramen of Monro and a left temporal external ventricular drain terminating in the left temporal horn. Again seen is extensive abnormal flair/T2 signal along the ependymal surfaces periventricular white matter corpus callosum and the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes. There is improvement in temporal horn dilatation since the prior study. There is diffuse abnormality of the corpus callosum which may be secondary to ventriculitis or prior VP shunting. Again seen is extensive ependymal enhancement along the bilateral lateral ventricles third ventricle and bilateral temporal horns. However there has been interval decrease in restricted diffusion around the ventricles and genu of the corpus collosum suggesting improvement of ventriculitis. There is dural enhancement along the entire right hemisphere with a stable adjacent subdural fluid collection without midline shift or significant mass-effect which most likely represents post surgical changes from recent frontal-parietal craniotomy and not an empyema. There are also postsurgical changes from prior left temporal craniotomy. Intracranial flow voids are maintained. There is mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses. Retention cysts and layering debris are seen in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION:

1. Persistent ventriculitis with slight interval improvement as evidenced by decrease in associated restricted diffusion. 2. Interval improvement of temporal horn dilatation. 3. Postsurgical changes from recent frontal temporal craniotomy. This MR does not have characteristic features of an empyema.
