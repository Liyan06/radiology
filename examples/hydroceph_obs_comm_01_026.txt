Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

Coil mass in the expected region of the right posterior communicating artery. Again seen is a left frontal entry ventricular catheter with tip terminating near the right foramen of Monro along the right caudothalamic groove unchanged in position. Slight decrease in size of ventricles. Diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity in the sulci may be a combination of evolving subarachnoid hemorrhage and recent intubation and percentage of inspired oxygen. Single small focus of restricted diffusion in left frontal lobe. No acute midline shift extra-axial collection or hydrocephalus. Time of flight MRA without contrast is less sensitive for evaluation of coiled aneurysms but allowing for technique and the predominance of the coiled right posterior communicating artery aneurysm is excluded from the intracranial circulation. There may be trace flow (series 2 images 28 and 29) at the base. Left A-1 segment appears atretic. There is slight asymmetry in flow-related enhancement in the MCA territories with slightly less on the left side. No other aneurysms are seen. Please note MRA is less sensitive for aneurysms less than 4 mm. Mild mucosal changes of ethmoid air cells. Mild fluid in left mastoids more than right.
IMPRESSION:

1. Post coiling of ruptured right posterior feeding artery aneurysm with possible trace filling of the aneurysm base. This could be further evaluated on follow-up imaging. 2. Small focus of restricted diffusion left frontal lobe. 3. Evolving subarachnoid hemorrhage. Discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Jacobs at approximately 3pm on 8/18/08.
