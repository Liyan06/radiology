Diseases: ['meningioma', 'hemangiopericytoma']
FINDINGS:

There is a large right parafalcine enhancing extra-axial mass measuring 8.1 x 6.1 x 4.6 cm with a broad-based dural tail and smaller left parafalcine component most consistent with a meningioma. There is associated prominent vasogenic edema in the right hemispheric centrum semiovale and corona radiata with associated marked mass effect on the adjacent right cerebrum. There is approximately 15 mm of right to left midline shift. There is mild inferior displacement of the brain. The basal cisterns are patent. The tumor appears to be intimately related to the pericallosal vessels. There is invasion and probable occlusion of the mid aspect of the superior sagittal sinus. There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. 1.9-cm cavernoma is noted just lateral to the occipital horn left lateral ventricle with associated developmental venous anomaly. Incidental note of a 6-mm right choroid plexus cyst is noted. There are no extra-axial fluid collections. There is no ventriculomegaly. Mild ethmoidal mucosal changes are noted.
IMPRESSION:

1. 8.1-cm predominately right parafalcine extra-axial tumor with associated edema and mass effect as detailed above including right to left midline shift and subfalcine herniation. This appears intimately related with the pericallosal arteries. There is invasion and probable occlusion of the mid superior sagittal sinus without evidence of acute venous ischemia. This is most consistent with meningioma. Less likely a hemangiopericytoma could appear like this. 2. 1.9-cm left periventricular cavernoma with associated capillary telangiectasia and developmental venous anomaly.
