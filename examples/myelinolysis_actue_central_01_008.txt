Diseases: ['myelinolysis']
FINDINGS:

There is no acute infarct intracranial hemorrhage extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. The cerebral volume is appropriate for the patient's stated age. There is T2 prolongation within the pons without associated enhancement or diffusion restriction. In addition there are a few scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the white matter. Following contrast administration there is no pathologic enhancement. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute infarction. 2. T2 prolongation within the pons. This likely reflect sequela of microvascular disease however may also be seen in the setting of central pontine myelinolysis; favor microvascular disease. Clinical correlation is advised. Additional scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the white matter are nonspecific however most commonly seen in the setting of chronic microvascular change. Above findings discussed with and acknowledged by Dr. Demarco at 3 p.m. 6/14/09.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
