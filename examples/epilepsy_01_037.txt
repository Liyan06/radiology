Diseases: ['normal']
FINDINGS:

Again seen is left frontal craniotomy and resection cavity. Small dural-based nodule of enhancement (4 mm) in the resection cavity on image 17 of series 12 is unchanged compared to the scan from 2009 suggesting for differences in field strength and slice thickness. This probably represents postsurgical granulation tissue small recurrent meningioma cannot be completely excluded. No intracranial hemorrhage infarct or mass effect. No parenchymal mass. Outside of the surgical cavity no abnormal enhancement of the parenchyma or meninges. Major intracranial flow voids are present. The hippocampi are symmetric and normal with respect to architecture and signal. The forniceal column and remainder of the limbic system are also unremarkable. There is evidence of left frontal cortical susceptibility effect see image 48 series 5 and T2 prolongation in the cortex see image 15 series 3. These could provide an epileptogenic focus. Small amount of mucosal thickening present in the right mastoid tip. Mild paranasal sinus the coastal thickening.
IMPRESSION:

1. Redemonstration of left frontal craniotomy and resection cavity. Small (4 mm) dural based nodule of enhancement alogn nthe dura in the surgical bed is stable from 2009. 2. Normal appearance of the hippocampi and limbic system. There is cortical abnormality described above in the left frontal lobe correlate with history this could provide an epileptogenic focus. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
