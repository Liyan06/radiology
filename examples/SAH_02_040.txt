Diseases: ['aneurysm', 'encephalomalacia', 'encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

Images are degraded by motion. Again noted is evidence of an encephalomalacia related to old infarction of the left frontoparietal region and encephalomalacia of the right anterior temporal lobe. Areas of increased T2 signal in a linear fashion within the right frontal lobe are also stable likely secondary to prior ventricular catheter placement. Other scattered areas of deep and periventricular white matter T2 prolongation probably represents sequela of small vessel ischemic changes. There are no areas of abnormal enhancement or restricted diffusion. Prominent lateral ventricles with ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle is redemonstrated. There appears to be filling at the base of the previously coiled supraclinoid right internal carotid aneurysm (series 4 image 74 or series 18 image 26) measuring at least 7 x 6 mm. The more distal supraclinoid right ICA/bifurcation into the right M1 and A1 segments is not well evaluated due to susceptibility from the aneurysm coils. The remainder of the intracranial arteries are patent. No other new areas of aneurysm or identified.
IMPRESSION:

1. Filling at the base of the previously coiled right supraclinoid internal carotid aneurysm measuring at least 7 x 6 mm. This can be further evaluated with conventional angiography. 2. Stable area of encephalomalacia within the left frontoparietal region secondary to old infarct. 3. Unchanged right temporal Encephalomalacia. 4. Unchanged sequela of chronic small vessel scaly changes. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
