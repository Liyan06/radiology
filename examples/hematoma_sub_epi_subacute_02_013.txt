Diseases: ['hematoma', 'hematoma']
FINDINGS:

There is large subacute intraparenchymal hematoma in the leftposterior parietal lobe with tiny adjacent subdural hematoma andsurrounding edema. There is a smaller subacute intraparenchymalhematoma in the left frontal lobe from the intracranial pressuremonitor placement. Surrounding edema is present. No significantmass effect or midline shift is noted. There are two small additionalfoci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in bilateral posterior parietallobes.There are relatively symmetric areas of T2 prolongation involvingsubcortical white matter in the posterior temporal parietal andoccipital lobes. These findings are most consistent with posteriorreversible leukoencephalopathy most likely due to eclampsia.There is no evidence of arterio-venous malformation.There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral sphenoid sinuses andbilateral mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with posterior reversibleleukoencephalopathy.2. Right posterior parietal subacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage withsmall adjacent subdural hematoma and surrounding edema.3. Subacute hematoma with surrounding edema in the left frontalregion from the intracranial pressure monitor placement.4. No evidence of arteriovenous malformation.Transcribed by: Interface TalkStationLast Edited by: HACKNEY DAVID B MD
