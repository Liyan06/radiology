Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

Again noted are multiple subtle enhancing foci best seen on post-contrast FLAIR less well seen on T1 postcontrast imaging without mass effect. For example: -Right posterior mesial frontal (image 23/12) slightly less apparent -Right mesial frontal convexity (image 18/12) -Right temporal (image 16/12) -Left operculum (image 16/12) -Left temporo-occipital (image 15/12) slightly less apparent -Left occipital (image 10/12) There is also a focal 2 mm area of enhancement in the right frontal basal region image 31/14 not seen on axial imaging. There is T2/FLAIR hyperintense focus in the right inferomedial cerebellum (image 6/12) as well as a smaller punctate focus (image 8/12) unchanged without definite enhancement. There is redemonstration of 11 mm enhancing nodule in the left choroid plexus of the left atrium stable to minimally decreased in size. No new focal brain parenchymal abnormalities extra-axial fluid collections or mass effect. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. Ventricles sulci and cisterns are symmetric and patent. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa and orbits are unremarkable
IMPRESSION:

1. No significant change in scattered foci of punctate enhancement as detailed above  consistent with metastases. No change in other indeterminate focal lesions as detailed. No new enhancing foci. 2. Focal solid nodular enhancement in the left choroid plexus stable to minimally decreased in size again could represent meningioma versus metastatic lesion. Continued attention on follow-up is recommended I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
