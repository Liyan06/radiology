Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There are multiple areas of T2 hyperintensity within the subcorticalwhite matter and cortex of the cerebrum bilaterally consistent withcortical tubers. In addition there are multiple calcifiedsubependymal nodules along the lateral ventricles. The findings arediagnostic of tuberous sclerosis. There is an enhancing mass in theregion of the left foramen of Monroe with punctate signal voidscompatible with calcification representing a giant cell astrocytoma.The lateral ventricles are enlarged left greater than right. Thereis no transependymal flow of CSF. There are bilateral ventriculostomycatheters.There is minimal bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION:

1. Cortical tubers subependymal nodules and subependymal giant cellastrocytoma near the left foramen of Monro consistent with tuberoussclerosis.2. Bilateral ventriculostomy catheters with enlargement of thelateral ventricles without transependymal flow of CSF suggestingchronic hydrocephalus.
