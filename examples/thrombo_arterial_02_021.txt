Diseases: ['hematoma']
FINDINGS:

There is continued evolution intraparenchymal left frontoparietal hematoma which measures approximately 4.5 x 1.8 x 2.6 CM in AP transverse and craniocaudal dimension respectively. There is surrounding edema and mass effect on the atria of the left lateral ventricle. The ventricle or system does not appear dilated. On gradient images there is a thin serpiginous focus of susceptibility effect in the anterior medial right frontal lobe adjacent to the hemorrhage this likely reflects a small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. No evidence for infarction based on diffusion weighted images. Moderate periventricular and subcortical T2/flair hyperintensities which are likely secondary to small vessel ischemic change. There is a moderate-sized probable mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. The remainder the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are essentially clear. The orbits are unremarkable MR venogram: There is flow within the superior sagittal sinus in particular adjacent to the hematoma. There is slight heterogeneous signal in the distal superior sagittal sinus however this is likely technical as there is no evidence of thrombus on the precontrast sagittal T1 weighted images. The left transverse sinus is dominant which is a normal variant. There is patency of the right transverse bilateral sigmoid and proximal internal jugular veins. The deep circulation including basal vein of Rosenthal internal cerebral veins and straight sinus are patent. Bilateral veins of LabbÃ© appear patent.
IMPRESSION:

1. Continued evolution of left frontoparietal hematoma. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis on conventional images or MR venogram as detailed above. 2. Probable chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the subcortical and periventricular matter.
