Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

There is diffuse T2/flair hyperintense signal abnormality involving the subcortical deep and periventricular white matter. Signal abnormality involves the basal ganglia thalami midbrain pons bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres. These findings have progressed since the prior MRI from January 18 2008. There is no abnormal enhancement following contrast administration. There is no restricted diffusion. No acute infarction mass effect or midline shift. There is persistent prominence of ventricles and sulci consistent with atrophy. There is suggestion of signal abnormality in the upper cervical cord seen on the flair sequence. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly clear. Nasogastric tube is visualized.
IMPRESSION:

1. Progression of signal abnormalities seen within the white matter deep gray matter nuclei brainstem and cerebellum. No definite evidence for lymphoma or toxoplasmosis. Differential considerations include however not limited to HIV encephalitis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Clinical correlation advised. 2. Suggestion of signal abnormality in the cervical cord seen on the flair sequence. If clinically indicated cervical spine MRI may be performed. Above discussed with Dr. Munson at 12 a.m. I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
