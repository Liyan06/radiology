Diseases: ['normal', 'hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

Many sequences are significantly motion degraded. There are punctate foci of acute infarct along the right motor cortex left centrum semiovale right occipital and medial temporal lobes. There are bilateral frontal left parietal right temporal areas of cortical laminar necrosis. There is extensive periventricular and deep white matter T2 prolongation nonspecific but likely the sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. Partially empty sella. While there is parenchymal volume loss the ventricles are diffusely dilated slightly out of proportion to degree of volume loss. No acute hemorrhage or midline shift. No abnormal extra axial collections. Post contrast images are severely motion degraded. No definite abnormal enhancement. Mucosal thickening right frontal ethmoid and axillary sinuses. Trace bilateral mastoid fluid. Bilateral cataract surgery. Appropriate flow voids are seen at the skull base. MRA is degraded by motion. The visible portions of the proximal vessels of the circle of Willis are probably within normal limits without definite aneurysm or focal narrowing.
IMPRESSION:

1. New scattered infarcts raise the possibility of embolic stroke with cortical laminar necrosis from prior events. 2. No definite abnormality of the proximal vessels of the circle of Willis. 3. Prominent ventricles slightly out of proportion to the degree of parenchymal volume loss raise the possibility of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Advise correlation with images of prior studies when they become available. Discussed with Dr. Morrissette at 9pm on 12/27/07.
