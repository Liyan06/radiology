Diseases: ['astrocytoma']
FINDINGS:

No abnormal focus of restricted diffusion is noted to suggest acute infarction. No acute intra-or extra-axial hemorrhage is noted. No abnormal focus of susceptibility is noted. Multiple areas of altered signal intensity are seen in bilateral frontal right parietal and occipital lobes largest in the left frontal region measuring approximately 25 x 24 mm in maximum dimensions. These are predominantly in the subcortical white matter with involvement of overlying cortex consistent with cortical dysplasia some of them may represent cortical tubers in this patient with tuberous sclerosis. None of these show evidence of T1 hyperintensity with no abnormal enhancement. Tiny subependymal nodules see image number 20 of series 3 and 4 noted along the lateral wall of left lateral ventricle. Tiny focus of enhancement is noted in the region of left foramen of Monro see image number 17 of series 11 which is thought to be vascular in etiology. However tiny subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in this location cannot be entirely excluded but less favored. No hydrocephalus or effacement of basal cisterns. No large intraorbital mass is noted. Visualized paranasal sinuses show evidence of mild mucosal disease. Bilateral mastoids appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple bilateral white matter lesions largest in the left frontal lobe consistent with cortical dysplasia. Some of these lesions may represent small cortical tubers. 2. Small subependymal nodules along the lateral wall of left lateral ventricle. 3. Tiny focus of enhancement in the region of left foramen of Monro is thought to be vascular in etiology. However small subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in this region cannot be entirely excluded. Attention to this area in follow-up imaging is recommended.
