Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is dilatation of the lateral and 3rd ventricles in keeping with hydrocephalus. There is transependymal flow of CSF. The 4th ventricle is not dilated. There is 20 x 20 mm heterogenous on T2 images and heterogeneously enhancing mass in the pineal region. There may be mild restricted diffusion in the periphery of the mass. The mass appears to be separate from the tectum which is being compressed. This lesion likely represents a neoplasm of pineal origin such as pineocytoma. A pineoblastoma or a germinoma are less likely given the age of the patient. There is obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct. As mentioned above a tectal neoplasm is thought to be less likely as well. Flow voids are maintained in the anterior and posterior circulation as well as the superior sagittal sinus. Pituitary fossa posterior fossa and both orbits are unremarkable. The vertebral bodies of the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine are in anatomic alignment. There is no area of abnormal marrow. The cervical and thoracic spinal cord is normal in signal and caliber. There is no definite abnormal enhancement. There is no evidence of intraspinal metastasis. The conus medullaris is located at the L1 level and is normal in appearance. The cauda equina is normal in appearance. Note is made of a T2-bright lesion in the liver.
IMPRESSION:

1. Heterogeneously enhancing probably pineal mass obstructing the aqueduct and causing hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of CSF. Differential diagnosis includes pineocytoma. Germ cell tumor pineoblastoma or tectal neoplasm are thought to be less likely.2. No definite spinal metastasis.
