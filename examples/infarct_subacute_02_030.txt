Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There is restricted diffusion in the left pons which is similar in size but more apparent on current examination. In addition the previously suspected region of restricted diffusion in the left midbrain is now also more apparent. Both are compatible with acute-early subacute infarction. The no additional areas of restricted diffusion. There has been interval increase in hyperintense T2 signal in the midbrain and pons. No extra-axial fluid collection or midline shift. Again noted are foci of susceptibility in the parietal lobes bilaterally likely prior microhemorrhages or potentially calcifications. There has been no significant interval change in a large fusiform basilar artery aneurysm. The surrounding thrombus appears similar. Although the MRA images demonstrate a segment of lost flow related signal the flow void is maintained compatible with a partially thrombosed aneurysm. There remains severe compression of the pons and to a lesser extent the lower brain stem. The intracranial internal carotid arteries remain patent bilaterally. The right A1 segment is atretic. The left A1 segment and bilateral M1 segments are patent. There is mucosal thickening and partial opacification of the paranasal sinuses diffusely. The mastoid air cells are partially opacified bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of a partially thrombosed large fusiform basilar artery aneurysm. 2. Left pons and midbrain infarctions now more apparent on diffusion imaging. Dr. Mullen was notified of these findings by phone at 6:50 pm on 1/3/2008. Attending note: I agree with the report above and have personally reviewed the images.
