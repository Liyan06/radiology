Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There are about five punctate foci of cortical infarct in bilateral hemispheres. Otherwise there is no large territory infarct. Scatter subarachnoid hemorrhage and layering blood in bilateral occipital horns are again seen. MRI evaluation of the circle Willis is slightly degraded by patient's motion demonstrating no large aneurysm. However small aneurysm cannot be excluded on this current examination or MRA. Intracranial vessels are patent. The lumbar spine demonstrates heterogeneous signal abnormality extending from the imaged T12 to L3 levels predominantly epidural with anterior displacement of the thecal sac best seen on series seen image 1-7 with complete effacement of the CSF space. Some of this is probably intrathecal as well with layering blood within the distal thecal sac. However the cranial extent of the collection is not imaged. The scout demonstrates significant susceptibility artifact of the thoracic and lumbar region unclear from the patient's internal hardware or external source.
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive heterogeneous/probably blood collection in the spinal canal from T12 to L3 levels predominantly in the dorsal epidural space with possible some intrathecal component with layering blood in the distal thecal sac resulting in anterior displacement of the thecal sac and severe effacement of the CSF at the distal conus. 2. Scattered punctate acute infarct most likely procedural related. 3. Patent intracranial vessel. No gross evidence of large aneurysm vascular malformation. However the current examination is not diagnostic for small aneurysm. Findings were communicated with cardiovascular neurology and neurosurgery service at around 9:30 AM 2/26/2010
