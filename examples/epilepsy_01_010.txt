Diseases: ['encephalomalacia']
FINDINGS:

There is redemonstration of encephalomalacia in the left anterior temporal and left frontal lobe extending to the opercular region without interval change. The location is suggestive of prior traumatic injury. Cerebral volume is markedly decreased for age without significant interval change which may be result of chronic epilepsy therapy. The hippocampi are symmetric and normal in signal and internal architecture. There is no intracranial hemorrhage infarct extra-axial collection mass or mass effect. There is no pathologic enhancement or restricted diffusion. There is no abnormal susceptibility. There is a nonenhancing odontogenic cyst arising from the left maxillary alveolar ridge projecting into the maxillary sinus unchanged from the prior study. There is diffuse mild because of thickening in the paranasal sinuses greater on the left. The left maxillary sinus is small. The orbits are normal. Major intracranial flow voids are present. The dural venous sinuses are patent.
IMPRESSION:

1. Redemonstration of encephalomalacia in the anterior left temporal and left frontal lobes location is suggestive of remote trauma. 2. Redemonstration of marked global volume loss without significant interval change. 3. Odontogenic cyst rising from the left maxillary alveolar ridge protruding into the left maxillary sinus without interval change. Diffuse mild paranasal mucosal inflammation. I certify that I have personally reviewed the image and interpretation for this examination and agree with the findings in this report.
