Diseases: ['meningioma']
FINDINGS:

There is stable decreased intensity of the anterior clivus inferior to the sphenoid sinus which enhances on postcontrast imaging. Again this is sclerotic on comparison CT. The poster nasal septum is again noted to be surgically absent. Fluid in the right mastoid air cells is present but improved. There is a 25 x 27 by 18 mm extra-axial mass right posterior frontal region near the vertex no abnormal signal in the underlying brain dark on T2-weighted images and concordant with calcified or ossified mass is seen on the comparison study. On postcontrast imaging the mass enhances and may extend slightly into the diploic space through the inner table. Findings are stable and most consistent with meningioma. Otherwise ventricles and CSF spaces are nearly symmetric and are age-appropriate. There are several small nonspecific hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in the deep and periventricular white matter possibly representing chronic subcortical small vessel ischemic changes. No acute ischemia appreciated. Air-containing foreign body described on a prior CT can still be seen in the superior medial orbit on the left but is less apparent on today's study. There is signal intensity suggestive of sclerosis left mandibular condyle which could be degenerative in nature seen also previously.
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable enhancing focal signal abnormality clivus corresponding to a sclerotic focus seen on comparison CT. 2. Stable extra-axial mass posterior right frontal region with possible involvement inner table and diploic space most consistent with meningioma. 3. Improving opacification right mastoid air cells. 4. Stable nonspecific white matter hyperintensities which may suggest chronic subcortical ischemic changes. No acute findings.
