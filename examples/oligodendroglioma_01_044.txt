Diseases: ['astrocytoma']
FINDINGS:

No change in wedge-shaped signal abnormality in right frontal lobe extending to the cortex mildly heterogeneous in signal and. Mild effacement of sulci no midline shift. No abnormal enhancement. Vague areas of signal abnormality in the periventricular white matter are stable. MR spectroscopy shows slight increase in choline and decrease in NAA. No significant increase in myo-inositol no significant evidence of lipid or lactate. MR perfusion shows a slight increase in suitable blood volume the tumor.
IMPRESSION:

1. No change in right frontal tumor suspect oligodendroglioma perhaps with chromosomal deletions given the slight increase in rCBV. Although the tumor does not enhance the heterogeneity of the tumor and the age of the patient suggest higher grade. Differential diagnosis includes astrocytoma DNET. 2. A research diamox-perfusion study was ordered but was not performed given the patient's sulfa allergy.
