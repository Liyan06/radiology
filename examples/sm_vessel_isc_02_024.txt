Diseases: ['infarction', 'infarction']
FINDINGS:

There is hyperacute infarction of the left anterior cerebral artery territory. There are multiple additional foci of diffusion restriction involving the posterior right MCA territory smaller foci within the left MCA territory left occipital cortex and punctate infarctions of the right greater than left cerebellar hemispheres are representing subacute infarction. Chronic infarction of the right centrum semi ovale as well as scattered chronic small vessel ischemic changes of the bilateral cerebral white matter are also present. No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is no abnormal extra-axial fluid collection. There has been bilateral lens extraction surgery. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The patient is orally intubated.
IMPRESSION:

1. Hyperacute infarction of the left anterior cerebral artery territory. 2. Subacute infarctions of the bilateral MCA territories right greater than left left occipital cortex and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. The bilaterality and involvement of the anterior and posterior circulation suggests a central embolic source. 3. Chronic infarction of the right centrum semi ovale. These findings were discussed with and confirmed by Dr. Flesch on February 1 2010 at 22:48.I certify that I have personally reviewed this examination and agreewith this report.
