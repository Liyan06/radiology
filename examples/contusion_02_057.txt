Diseases: ['contusion']
FINDINGS:

There are foci of hyperintensity on T1 weighted images in the cerebral sulci subdural space and along the tentorium in keeping with subarachnoid and acute on chronic subdural hemorrage. Hyperintensity on T2 and FLAIR images is seen in the bilateral frontal lobes right greater than left and bilateral temporal lobes from known contusions. Additional foci of high signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter as well the basal ganglia are nonspecific possibly age related small vessel ischemic disease. There is restricted diffusion in the region of the right frontal lobe contusion. Additional foci of restricted diffusion correspond to blood products. The basal cisterns are patent. The calvarium is normal in marrow signal. A ventriculostomy catheter is again noted entering via a right frontal heads and extending to the right lateral ventricle adjacent to the septum pellucidum. There is mild mucosal thickening in the bilateral frontal sinuses ethmoid air cells sphenoid sinuses with near total opacification of the right sphenoid sinus. The maxillary sinuses are clear. Prior bilateral cataract surgery is noted. The vertebral bodies are normal in height alignment and signal intensity. Intervertebral discs are normal in height. There is mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy at the C5 level. There is no abnormal signal in the ligaments to suggest cervical injury. The spinal cord is normal in size and signal intensity. The paraspinal soft tissues are normal. The cerebellar tonsils are normal in position. Note is made of bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of ligamentous injury in the cervical spine. 2. Evolving traumatic intracranial hemorrhages including subarachnoid and subdural blood as well as parenchymal contusions. 3. Restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe in region of contusion.
