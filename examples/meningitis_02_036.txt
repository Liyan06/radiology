Diseases: ['meningitis']
FINDINGS:

The ventricles and sulci are prominent likely related to age related volume loss. There is no evidence of intra or extra-axial hemorrhage. Scattered periventricular and subcortical white matter and brainstem T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are nonspecific but likely reflect sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in the appropriate clinical setting. There are no areas of abnormal enhancement in the brain parenchyma or meninges . CSF sampling is more sensitive for the detection of leukemic meningitis. There is circumferential mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus which has decreased in severity from the prior CT scan. There is near complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus which has an air-fluid level. Air-fluid level is also present in the left maxillary sinus and is slightly hyperintense on the T1 weighted images suggesting complex fluid. The visualized orbits and cavernous sinuses are unremarkable. There is diffusely decreased signal intensity of the calvarial marrow related to known hematologic malignancy. To the extent that they may be evaluated with routine MR imaging the vascular structures have a normal appearance.
IMPRESSION:

1. Inflammatory sinus disease involving bilateral maxillary sinuses and left sphenoid sinus. There is complex fluid within the left maxillary sinus. Fungal infection cannot be entirely excluded. There is no evidence of orbital or cavernous sinus extension.2. Probable age related volume loss with sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.3. No evidence of leukemic involvement in the brain or meninges. CSF sampling is more sensitive for the detection of leukemic meningitis. 4. Abnormal marrow signal intensity secondary to known hematologic malignancy.
