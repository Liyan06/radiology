Diseases: ['infarction', 'amyloid']
FINDINGS:

There is global parenchymal volume loss. There are areas of low T1 signal and thinning of the corpus callosum. Several foci and confluent areas of hyperintense T2 signal are noted in the subcortical periventricular and deep white matter and corona radiata. There are additional foci of hyperintense T2 signal in the base of ganglia bilaterally and brainstem likely old lacunar infarctions. A few small foci of probable restricted diffusion are noted in the left parietal and occipital lobes although these are difficult to visualize on the ADC map. There are several small foci of susceptibility on the gradient echo imaging most numerous within the cerebellar hemispheres but also in the brainstem left parietal lobe right temporal lobe right occipital lobe right thalamus and right insula likely foci of chronic microhemorrhage. There are also small foci of T1 shortening in the right occipital lobe and possibly in the left temporal lobe which may represent areas of subacute hemorrhage. No extra-axial fluid collection mass effect or midline shift. After the administration of contrast there is no pathologic enhancement. The left maxillary sinus is completely opacified and is small with associated left maxillary sinus bony thickening consistent with atelectasis and chronic obstruction. An endotracheal tube is partially visualized.
IMPRESSION:

1. Chronic ischemic white matter disease and old lacunar infarctions as above. A few small foci of probable acute or subacute infarction are noted in the left parietal and occipital lobes. 2. Numerous small foci of chronic hemorrhage greatest in the cerebellar hemispheres and to a lesser extent within the supratentorial parenchyma. Favor hypertensive microhemorrhages as an etiology. Differential considerations include amyloid angiopathy or multiple small cavernomas although these are felt to be less likely.
