Diseases: ['schwannoma']
FINDINGS:

There are expected postsurgical changes from left suboccipital craniotomy noting high T1/T2 signal in the surgical bed that likely represents fat packing. The previously seen enhancing mass in the left cerebellopontine angle has been resected without definite evidence of residual macroscopic neoplasm though evaluation is somewhat limited by the adjacent high T1/T2 signal. There is pneumocephalus with air overlying the anterior frontal lobes bilaterally. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial collection. There are no areas of mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal as to size shape and position. The basal cisterns are patent. There is a focus of mild and ill-defined contrast enhancement in the left anterior/medial frontal lobe with equivocal associated signal abnormality on other sequences and without associated mass effect (image 17 series 8) unchanged dating back to prior outside MRI dated 6/2/2011. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The patient is status post bilateral lens surgery.
IMPRESSION:

1. Expected postsurgical changes from left suboccipital craniotomy for resection of left vestibular schwannoma without definite evidence of residual macroscopic neoplasm; recommend follow-up study when clinically warranted at which time dedicated IAC protocol is needed. 2. Mildly enhancing focus in the left anterior frontal lobe unchanged since 6/2/2011 most likely a capillary telangiectasia. ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST AGREEMENT: I have personally reviewed the images and agree with this report.
