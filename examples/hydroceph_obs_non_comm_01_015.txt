Diseases: ['hydrocephalus']
FINDINGS:

There is enlargement of the ventricular system with enlargement of the third ventricle and funnel type appearence of the cerebral aqueduct. There is no evidence of trasependymal flow or prominent sulci. These findings likely represent an obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis. If clinically indicated MRI flow may be helpful for confirmation. There is a cysterna magna incidental finding. There are multiple areas of T2 prolongation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter this is nonspecific in etiology and may represent sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. There is no intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift. There is no pathologic enhancement. There is a very small fluid level in the left maxillary sinus. There is patency of the intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segements. There are no regions of focal stenosis or aneurysm formation. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 5 mm. There is patency of the bilateral vertebral arteries. There is a prominent right vertebral artery a normal variant. There is a hypoplastic distal left vertebral artery normal variant. The bilateral common carotid cervical internal carotid and external carotid arteries are patent. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis.
IMPRESSION:

1. Findings consistent with mild obstructive hydrocephalus possibly secondary to aqueductal stenosis. If clinically indicated MRI flow may be helpful for confirmation and clinical correlation is suggested regarding its significance. 2. Patency of the intracranial circulation as above. 3. Patency of the neck vasculature.
