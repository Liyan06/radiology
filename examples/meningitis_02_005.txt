Diseases: ['aneurysm']
FINDINGS:

There is abnormal FLAIR signal not definitely seen on pre-contrast T1 in multiple predominantly left-sided sulci in the temporal and frontal regions possibly representing subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lumbar puncture could be performed. There is no extracerebral fluid collection midline shift or mass effect. There is no pathologic enhancement. Incidental note of right cataract surgery and scleral banding. There are mild mucosal changes in the right maxillary sinus and the ethmoid air cells. There is patency of the intracranial circulation including the bilateral distal vertebral arteries basilar artery and its distal branches the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries and the A1 and M1 segements. The right A1 segment is slightly hypoplastic. The left intradural vertebral artery is dominantly. There are no regions of focal stenosis or aneurysm formation. Please note MRA is less sensitive for those aneurysms under 4 mm. There is normal arch anatomy. There is patency of the bilateral vertebral arteries. The left cervical vertebral artery is slightly dominant. The bilateral common carotid cervical internal carotid and external carotid arteries are patent. There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis (0% by NASCET criteria).
IMPRESSION:

1. Possible predominantly left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage. No other significant intracranial abnormality. 2. Widely patent cervical and intracranial anterior and posterior circulations without focal stenosis aneurysm or vascular malformation. Dr. Grady was notified of these findings at 10:50.
