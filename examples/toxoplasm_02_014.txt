Diseases: ['toxoplasmosis', 'sarcoidosis']
FINDINGS:

Nonspecific foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the left frontal right frontal left parieto-occipital left temporal and right occipital regions. The largest lesion measures 1.5 x 1 cm on image 19/3 and demonstrates ring enhancement after gadolinium administration. A left frontal lobe lesion and the left temporal lobe lesion demonstrate restricted diffusion (image 88 series 5). Differential includes demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis infectious etiologies such as Lyme disease opportunistic infections such as toxoplasmosis and vasculitis. Metastatic disease is considered highly unlikely. Correlation with CSF and immune status is recommended. Normal ventricular size and position without mass effect midline shift or edema. No intra- or extra-axial fluid collections or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Diffusion weighted imaging demonstrates no increased signal foci to suggest acute ischemia or infarction. Gradient echo imaging shows no decreased signal foci to suggest hemosiderin depostion within the brain. Preserved flow voids in the anterior and posterior circulation. Mucous retention cyst/polyp in the left maxillary sinus. Mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. Rim enhancement of one lesion and restricted diffusion at 1-2 other lesions may suggest varying ages of these lesions. Differential diagnosis includes demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis or ADEM infectious etiologies such as Lyme disease opportunistic infections such as toxoplasmosis and inflammatory etiologies such as vasculitis and sarcoidosis. Metastatic disease considered highly unlikely. Correlation with CSF and immune status is recommended. 2. Mild paranasal sinus disease. Findings discussed wtih Dr. Raser at 9:20 PM 3.11.10.
