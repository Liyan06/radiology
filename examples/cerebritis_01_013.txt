Diseases: ['abscess']
FINDINGS:

Further decrease in size of enhancing right caudate lesion further decrease in edema. No mass effect. No new areas of edema no new areas of enhancement no acute ischemia. No orbital mass. Extra-ocular muscles are unremarkable. Optic nerves are tortuous as before but otherwise unremarkable. There is some debris in the right globe as before. Questionable enhancement at the posterior right globe probably not changed.
IMPRESSION:

1. Further decrease in right caudate lesion likely response to treatment of fungal abscess. 2. Debris and possible enhancement in right globe. Ophthalmologic examination suggested.
