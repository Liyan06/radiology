Diseases: ['encephalitis']
FINDINGS:

Encephalomalacia left frontal and parietal lobe corresponds to posterior division MCA territory is most consistent with chronic infarct. No blood products identified on gradient echo images in this location. There is mild increased intensity in the dorsolateral thalamus on FLAIR images nonspecific not well seen on other sequences. Also on FLAIR images there is mild increased intensity left hippocampus with mild volume loss in least in posterior portion signal asymmetry less well appreciated on T2 weighted images. The ventricles and CSF spaces elsewhere are nearly symmetric and age appropriate. No other areas of abnormal increased or decreased signal intensity and abnormal enhancement. Appropriate intracranial flow voids are appreciated. There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus with internal dark material on T2 weighted images and minimally bright with on T1-weighted images represent inspissated secretions or concretions appears chronic on this exam but opacification has increased since September 18 2012 CT/PET. There is inflammatory change also in posterior left ethmoid air cells and scattered elsewhere.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease no acute findings. 2. Old branch MCA infarct on left. 3. Suspect mild increased intensity and decreased volume left hippocampus compared to right best seen on FLAIR images and possible mild increased intensity dorsolateral thalamus. This is a different vascular territory correlate for history of seizure activity limbic encephalitis unlikely. 4. Inflammatory changes paranasal sinuses most prominent sphenoid sinus where these have chronic appearance and possible central inspissated secretions. Opacification has increased since CT/PET September 18 2012
